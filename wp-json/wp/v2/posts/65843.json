You&#8217;re not alone. Highly specialized talent is hard enough to hire for but even harder to hold onto considering the aggressive poaching that occurs between leading companies and the fact that millennials tend to follow the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescoachescouncil\/2017\/05\/10\/millennials-arent-job-hopping-theyre-jumping-at-opportunity\/#719f03926f2d\">best opportunity available<\/a>\u00a0to them, leading to reduced retention rates for businesses across industries. Which is why managers like yourself suddenly\u00a0are back in the stressful position of filling another challenging and unexpected vacancy. Each day that passes with\u00a0the role left\u00a0vacant costs time and money that fast-moving, innovative\u00a0departments simply don&#8217;t have. Before you rush into\u00a0hiring the first candidate that checks a few of your requirement boxes, consider the following strategies on what to do when you have an urgent hiring need instead. Trust us; you&#8217;ll be happy you did.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>Urgent Hiring Need Solutions:<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner column_width_percent=&#8221;90&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;color-210407&#8243;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Tap your networks.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The time to call in that favor from your professional connections is when you&#8217;re facing an urgent hiring need for specialized and in-demand Tech or Digital Marketing talent. Before you look to the overly saturated job posting sites for your available role, reach out to everyone and anyone in your network that might have the connection to the (likely passive) talent you&#8217;re looking to entice. Your acquaintances and professional connections will be more likely to provide you with the hard-to-find talent you&#8217;re looking for and candidates sourced through this method are often more open to accepting the role since it was recommended to them from someone they trust in their network that is familiar with their skill set.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Offset skills gap temporarily.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If your professional networks are unable to provide you with the qualified candidates you need, consider offsetting the sudden skills gap on your team temporarily by hiring contract or freelance talent instead of looking for an immediate full-time fix. The last thing you want to do is onboard what turns out to be a bad full-time hire\u00a0and have to redo the process later on. Hiring for short-term contract talent for a sudden, urgent hiring need offers a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mondo.com\/blog-business-benefits-of-hiring-contract-talent-2017\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">variety of benefits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including reducing the urgency of the full-time role you&#8217;re looking to hire for which also minimizes the risk of making the wrong hire. You may find that the contract talent you hire as a short-term solution to the urgent hiring need could transition to become the right full-time hire you were after. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Limit the interview process length.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Today, the hiring and interview process takes <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3048421\/why-the-hiring-process-takes-longer-than-ever\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">longer than ever<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and a long process can result in your team losing out on a top candidate that is offered another opportunity in the time it takes for you to make a final decision. However, there are ways to mitigate this risk. Consider various strategies on how to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.informationweek.com\/strategic-cio\/team-building-and-staffing\/5-steps-that-can-shorten-the-it-hiring-process\/d\/d-id\/1326623?\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shorten the Tech hiring process<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. One option is accomplishing all the necessary interviews within 1 to 2 days. Do this by identifying the top 2 to 3 candidates and establishing a set interview schedule with time allotted for all the decision-makers involved in the process to get face time with the candidates within the same day, if possible. By limiting the number of times you&#8217;ll need to call in-demand talent back for yet another interview, you&#8217;ll be able to move on to the final testing phase and fill your urgent hiring need faster without losing out on your top options to competitors. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Outsource the hiring process. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to filling your urgent hiring need successfully, there are few options that provide you with the results that an external staffing agency can. Instead of wasting valuable time attempting to identify and recruit talent that is often not easily accessible, leave it to the experts like those here at Mondo. Our dedicated recruiters have spent years developing relationships with the passive talent found in our exclusive network and are specially equipped to solve your most challenging hiring needs as soon as they arise.
