As you\u2019re aware, AI integration has picked up over the last year or so and soon will have significant leverage on some of the most vital services and solutions we use daily. Which is why it\u2019s crucial your Tech business becomes aware of the subliminal human bias currently being passed onto AI-driven tech and implements effective strategies to end AI bias before it begins.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>The Birth of AI Bias<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine learning is indicative of the humans who create and develop AI technology. So if these machines that are amazing at crunching numbers and analyzing data are asked to mimic and replace humans, while uncovering patterns and the needs based on outcomes, it only makes sense that they\u2019d inadvertently adopt the unconscious biases of\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/40536485\/now-is-the-time-to-act-to-stop-bias-in-ai\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their creators<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, several studies show that Tech companies must be mindful and catch these biases before integrating AI and other ML-powered devices because of the potential prejudicial consequences. In 2016,\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/parmyolson\/2018\/02\/26\/artificial-intelligence-ai-bias-google\/#4b0859a01a01\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft learned firsthand<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0why it\u2019s essential to check for bias before opening AI services to the public. Their AI chatbot, Tay, proved that it was capable of mimicking human behavior but not yet able to determine what is an acceptable behavior to copy. Tay ended up sending out inappropriate tweets, and after 16 hours the bot was shut down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, AI bias, if not controlled, will only add to the widespread diversity issues the entire Tech industry is facing. For instance, when using AI recruiting software, companies have already noticed biased word embeddings and occupational stereotypes subliminally transferred to these technologies. Recent facial recognition systems advertently skipped past women and minority groups or in error\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pdfs.semanticscholar.org\/2744\/59c52103f9b7880d0697aa28755ac3366987.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">labeled them as homemakers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0based on their gender, or in the case of a failed Google AI experiment,\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-12-04\/researchers-combat-gender-and-racial-bias-in-artificial-intelligence\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">labeled minorities as primates<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0instead of Tech talent.

A diverse staff is also key to removing and avoiding bias. A diverse business will have more awareness of issues like race, gender, and sexuality, which will decrease the chance of AI bias as early as the\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com\/news\/252436163\/Expert-panel-warns-developers-to-beware-of-AI-bias\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">development stage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Ultimately\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mondo.com\/blog-intersectionality-in-tech\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a company lacking diversity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0will encounter data bias, which will likely be amplified by the AI technology that is directly interacting with consumers unless programmed differently. These machines utilize biased information, and an unintentional stereotype is created; this stereotype is likely to cause a decrease in customer retention. Meanwhile, the more diverse your staff is, is the more likely you are to catch this biased information before it becomes embedded in your AI-based tools or released to the public in the form of a stereotype-driven social media campaign or an inappropriate chatbot.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Improve AI Training.\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam Kalai, Co-author of \u201cMan is to Computer as Woman is to Homemaker?

Kalai goes on to compare AI to human babies, and he\u2019s right in the sense that AI, much like children, will mirror the input you&#8217;ve given it, no matter positive or negative. Your Tech business must reevaluate how you train those developing and working on these technologies to ensure these machine learning devices have a socially-conscious methodology. Reconfiguring your training methods will help dismantle hidden biases, leaving little room for those stereotypes to reach the AI.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To craft the best experience for your internal staff and consumers, your Tech business must secure ML experts who are well-versed in AI development and know how to avoid introducing subliminal biases to AI-driven technologies.
