However, many businesses and marketing teams are unclear on how to develop effective influencer marketing strategies that will produce the results they need.<\/p>\n<p>There are several steps to creating a successful influencer campaign and a variety of variables that companies need to consider when crafting influencer marketing strategies for their marketing goals.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a look at a few crucial strategies your business should implement to successfully\u00a0net top influencers and reach a larger audience, while boosting conversion rates and engagement with content:[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>&#8211; Establish clear goals for the influencer marketing campaign.<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Before you begin researching and tapping influencers that are thought leaders in your niche market, it&#8217;s crucial for your marketing team to establish specific\u00a0goals of what they hope to accomplish with the influencer marketing campaign. Push for specificity. What percentage increase in audience reach are you looking to achieve? What specific metrics will you be tracking to gauge the effectiveness of various influencers?<\/p>\n<p>Another key element is clearly defining your online audience so you can understand who impacts your target audience and influences their purchasing decisions. If you don&#8217;t know your audience&#8217;s pain points inside and out, as well as which content they engage with most, then you&#8217;ll be unsuccessful in your attempts to engage them.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>&#8211; Research, identify, and reach out to high quality influencers, as well as minor influencers.<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]In our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/identifying-high-quality-influencers-vital-marketing-strategy\/\">previous blog post<\/a>, we discussed the importance of researching and identifying high quality influencers to your influencer marketing campaign. This step is critical in producing the specific goals you have outlined for the campaign. Doing research on various social media platforms to discover the individuals that create and share content that impacts your consumer&#8217;s decision-making process is the only way to isolate the proven thought leaders you&#8217;ll need to reach out to and connect with.<\/p>\n<p>Another element of influencer marketing strategies that perceptive marketers\u00a0are beginning to incorporate is identifying and reaching out to minor influencers.<\/p>\n<p>Although these individuals may not have as much influence currently as the core thought leaders that make up your campaign, they have reach and influence on smaller social groups and are often up-and-coming influencers, which means tapping them early will pay off later as their audience size and influence grows.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>&#8211; Tailor the content and the influencer to the platform.<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/technorati.com\/report\/2013-dir\/creating-influence\/\">2013 Digital Influence Report<\/a> by Technorati, 92% of influencers use Facebook, 88% use Twitter, 76% use LinkedIn, and 74% use YouTube and Google+. Because of the various platforms that influencers post on, it&#8217;s essential to tailor the content your influencers are posting to each platform. What works on Facebook won&#8217;t work on Twitter and vice versa.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to establish a posting schedule for each platform to ensure the content is reaching as many users as possible, since users typically frequent certain platforms on set days and times of the week.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>&#8211; Stay engaged with the conversation on social.<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Many businesses are beginning to realize the importance of staying engaged with the social media conversation about their brand, which oftentimes leads to influencers talking about them organically.<\/p>\n<p>By sharing influencer posts, commenting, liking, and further establishing a connection between your business and your influencers, you create more authority and credibility for your company in the eyes of consumers which leads to additional audience engagement and traction for your brand across social platforms.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>&#8211; Track engagement and consider exclusive development deals for\u00a0top influencers.<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]A critical component of influencer marketing strategies is tracking the engagement of the content your influencers post.
