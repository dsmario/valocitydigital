Or a few of your top-ranking website pages have now been removed from Google&#8217;s search index entirely. Or maybe your\u00a0website simply isn&#8217;t netting the organic search leads it once did. So, what&#8217;s the deal? You&#8217;ve most likely been hit with a Google penalty.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>The Scoop on Google Penalties &amp; SEO Basics<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Google played the largest role in creating the SEO industry we know today.\u00a0After launching their search toolbox extension in 2000, Google made it their goal to provide users with the highest quality content possible\u00a0by ranking websites based on set parameters and algorithm updates. These updates are now purposefully kept secret from the public following widespread implementation of SEO manipulation strategies based on the search rank parameters Google previously supplied the public with. (Today, entire websites are dedicated to tracking and alerting the public about\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/google-algorithm-change\">possible algorithm changes<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>To filter out the spammy sites, Google introduced major overhauls to their search algorithm that targeted sites with poor quality content or ones that used\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/computer.howstuffworks.com\/search-engine-optimization3.htm\">black-hat SEO techniques<\/a>\u00a0like keyword stuffing or duplicate content. Which brings us to today: A time when Google&#8217;s search algorithm updates are done in total secrecy, and SEO experts and Digital Marketing Managers alike work hard to stay abreast of any sudden or noticeable changes in their search engine rankings.<\/p>\n<p>So, back to your issue. Your website&#8217;s rankings have taken a dive, or your organic search leads have suddenly run dry. These are often clear indicators an element of your website has been flagged by Google for violating a quality guideline they use to establish page rankings for search queries AKA you just received your first Google Penalty.<\/p>\n<p>How can you know for sure? You can find any manual penalties in your\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/webmasters\/tools\/\">Google Webmaster Tools<\/a>\u00a0account that&#8217;s linked to your website. In the Search Console, you will see any manual penalties listed along with a description of why your site attracted the penalty.\u00a0The other type of Google penalty is an algorithmic penalty. These are applied automatically without assistance from human employees, which means they are harder to identify and resolve.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>Solve Your Google Penalty Problem<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is it&#8217;s possible to reverse the damage done by Google penalties, and either\u00a0have\u00a0them removed or clean up the flagged pages, so your full website gets added back into Google&#8217;s search index.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For manual penalties, the process is pretty cut and dry since your site was penalized by an actual Google employee. If you address the issue within your website raised by the penalty and remedy it (i.e., remove keyword stuffing, delete spammy or paid links, delete duplicate content), then you can submit a reconsideration request to the Google employee. After reviewing the request, the penalty is typically lifted and the page in question returns, often with a much lower ranking, to Google&#8217;s index.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For algorithmic penalties, the process is more complicated because you&#8217;re not dealing with an actual human and likely won&#8217;t receive any alert you&#8217;ve been penalized. Instead, Marketers track their website traffic, organic search leads, and keyword rankings and compare the timeline of major disruptions to these results with any recent news on possible algorithm changes to isolate the reason for the potential penalty. If you&#8217;re aware of sketchy SEO practices your website has used to rank high in SERPs, it&#8217;s likely that the algorithm has finally caught on as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The best way to resolve an algorithmic Google penalty, especially when you&#8217;re unable to isolate the cause, is to methodically go through every page of your website and clean them up. Remove any remotely suspect links, duplicate content,\u00a0low-quality content, and any other black-hat SEO techniques. You&#8217;ll also want to do an audit to resolve any glitches or 404 pages on your website that can result in a Google penalty.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, for those not fully versed in the best practices and latest updates of SEO and Google&#8217;s algorithm, resolving issues stemming from a Google penalty is a full-time job; one that many Marketers are unqualified or unprepared to take on. Combing through websites with numerous SEO issues can take anywhere from weeks to months to complete even with several SEO experts working on it, which means regaining those covetable rankings will take much longer and your company&#8217;s bottom line will be negatively impacted for the foreseeable future.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>SEO Hires (More Than) Worth The Investment<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]This is why a majority of businesses, especially enterprise-level, have hired on-site experts to handle and resolve their SEO needs.
