Sure, you&#8217;re already offering a competitive salary range, but if your workplace perks aren&#8217;t aligned with what the\u00a0current Tech talent pool is being offered, then you&#8217;ll continue to lose out on qualified applicants to competitors currently offering the most in-demand workplace perks for top Tech talent.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>In-Demand Workplace Perks for Top Tech Talent<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]While you may offer one or two of the options listed below, consider connecting with HR and your fellow execs to see how many more in-demand workplace perks for top Tech talent your company can offer. Calculate the ROI the high-end, niche Tech experts you&#8217;re looking to hire will offer your business when discussing the subsequent costs related to adding the perks. A better understanding of the business benefits these perks offers, despite the minimal added costs to the business, will help your fellow execs understand the necessity of adding them.[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner column_width_percent=&#8221;90&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-thumbs-o-up&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;color-210407&#8243;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remote flexibility.<\/strong>\u00a0The highly qualified Developers we place prefer to accept offers from companies with flexible remote work policies. This is by far one of the most in-demand workplace perks for top Tech talent today. The best Tech talent available looks for positions that require them to be on-site only one to two days per week and trust them to complete their remaining tasks for the rest of the week wherever they work best, whether that&#8217;s in a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wework.com\/\">WeWork space<\/a>\u00a0or at their home office. Additionally, this is a strategic perk to offer if you can&#8217;t match the top salaries that Tech giants like Google offer to entice and poach candidates. Applicants will be more apt to consider a job offer with a lower salary if\u00a0it provides them greater remote work flexibility.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Flex scheduling.<\/strong>\u00a0The surge in flex scheduling perks offered to top Tech talent goes to show that the typical 9 to 5 format is not conducive to getting the best work from your Tech experts, whether they&#8217;re a Data Scientist or Demandware Developer. Informing applicants up-front or in their first in-person interview that the business offers flex scheduling shows the candidate that the company values the work they produce over antiquated business policies like set start and end times for each day. This openness to new ways of doing things will go far in attracting Tech talent that more often than not prefers to operate autonomously at a time that works best for them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Choice of tech.<\/strong>\u00a0For Tech Project Managers, Developers, Analysts, and more a key consideration when accepting a new job is whether or not they&#8217;ll be involved in the decision-making process on which technologies are used for different projects. This can be a major factor in accepting or rejecting a job offer as some Tech professionals work best in, and prefer, specific tech tools, languages, solutions, and platforms.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Professional development.\u00a0<\/strong>This doesn&#8217;t mean simply stating that your business is open to having your employees pursue professional development or educational opportunities. State how much budget you are willing to allocate to the individual&#8217;s professional development. Provide examples of what other employees have been able to pursue through the company&#8217;s assistance. Showing that you&#8217;re willing to invest in their professional development interests proves you are invested in their future at your business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Trending Perks.\u00a0<\/strong>New, &#8220;hot&#8221; perks are always being promoted by companies like Google or Apple that have the budgets to offer more luxurious benefits meant to entice the best Tech talent available. While you may not be able to afford the same perks, look to these companies and do regular research on the latest in-demand perks for Tech Talent before you initiate the hiring process. The latest trending perks include relaxed dress codes (a staple for most Tech teams), in-office yoga, and bring your pet to work policies. Things like relaxed dress codes and pet-friendly policies cost the business next to\u00a0nothing but greatly impact employee satisfaction and retention rates.<\/li>\n<li><strong>*Exclusive to start-ups: Equity.\u00a0<\/strong>While a majority of these workplace perks for top Tech talent apply to both enterprise-level and startup-level businesses, an equity offer is a perk that primarily applies to up-and-coming businesses or startups, unless your business is looking to net a new CIO or other Senior-level roles. If you are in the startup space and are struggling to attract the top Tech talent you need to get off the ground floor a small equity\u00a0percentage offer is a perk that will go a long way in attracting\u00a0the talent you&#8217;re missing. If you can&#8217;t break through or\u00a0net top\u00a0investors without the missing talent, consider increasing the equity offer. It&#8217;s a small price to pay now for substantial success down the road.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>How Much Do Perks Actually Matter?<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]More than you think. We&#8217;ve written extensively on the growing Tech talent gap, and although it will eventually improve, right now high-end, qualified Tech applicants are the ones with the power rather than employers. Qualified applicants typically receive more than one job offer, which means, ultimately, &#8220;it comes down to what is the work and what is the pay. But between two comparable positions, the perks help,&#8221; according to Carter Lowe, an experienced Enterprise Technical Recruiter at Mondo, in a recent\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.techrepublic.com\/article\/the-10-workplace-perks-that-tech-professionals-want-the-most\/\">TechRepublic article<\/a>\u00a0on the topic.<\/p>\n<p>While attracting the highly-skilled applicants with the most in-demand workplace perks for top Tech talent should be your first priority, the next challenge is learning how to retain that talent, especially in the Tech industry where\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mondo.com\/tech-retention-threat-employee-mistreatment\/\">retention rates are much lower<\/a>\u00a0than other industries. Providing workplace perks for top Tech talent that align with the current marketplace trends is a great start, but it&#8217;s crucial to prioritize intangible benefits as well. There will always be another business trying to poach talent from your teams by offering better salaries, free lunches, or other trendy perks, which is why you need to prioritize developing an inviting, inclusive, and supportive work environment that makes your employees want to remain a part of. Focusing on creating this type of environment for your Tech teams and offering the perks this talent group wants most will enable you to attract better quality talent and fill the talent gaps on your team\u00a0faster and more effectively.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re unable to attract or find the top Tech talent necessary for your immediate Tech needs,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/mondo.com\/contact\/\">contact Mondo<\/a>\u00a0today.
