Gender parity\u00a0in\u00a0tech and Hollywood, specifically, have received renewed focus as of late\u00a0thanks to hundreds of brave women from both industries speaking out about the lack of representation they face and the lack of equal pay they receive for doing the same job as male colleagues. Currently, women earn on average\u00a0around\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/research\/studies\/gender-pay-gap\/\">76 cents<\/a>\u00a0to every dollar men earn. However, things are looking up as awareness is driving real change, especially in tech. Here&#8217;s a look at several companies working toward gender parity in the male-dominated tech industry.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h2>What is Gender Parity?<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Before we get started, it&#8217;s important we&#8217;re all on the same page. Gender parity\u00a0is another way of saying gender equality but in a more tangible, data-driven way. Gender parity\u00a0refers to a statistical measure that compares a specific\u00a0indicator among women to the same indicator among men. What we are focusing on in this article is the female-to-male ratio of employees at tech companies or in tech departments and the average salaries of females vs. those of males in a similar role.<\/p>\n<p>Now, back to the\u00a0insights\u00a0you came for.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>Companies\u00a0Actively Pursuing Gender Parity in Tech<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<strong>Intel.\u00a0<\/strong>Back in 2015, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3657636\/intel-300-million-diversity-pledge\/\">pledged $300 million<\/a>\u00a0to increase the company&#8217;s workforce diversity with the goal of reaching equal representation among its 50,000 U.S. employees. The money is being invested in training and recruiting female and other groups of under-represented computer scientists, and it seems to be paying off. The tech company set the metrics of their equal representation goals based on market availability and is on track to reach their diversity goals. When Intel first made their diversity pledge, the company had a gap of around 2,300 workers to reach their goals. Two and a half years later and the business has seen a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/08\/15\/intel-ceo-in-new-diversity-report-lets-turn-this-tragedy-into-action\/\">65 percent improvement<\/a>\u00a0in the representation of female and minority talent.<\/p>\n<p>Intel also announced it had\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2016\/04\/11\/facebook-microsoft-gender-pay-gap\/#DUeh_ty5bZqg\">eliminated gender pay gaps<\/a>\u00a0between employees in 2015; years ahead of fellow competitors that have yet to reach equal pay among male and female workers. Intel proves that prioritizing gender parity in tech is possible, without sacrificing revenue or results.<\/p>\n<p><strong>General Electric.\u00a0<\/strong>GE is arguably one of the tech companies doing the most to reach tech gender parity with an aggressive goal set\u00a0to reach a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ge.com\/reports\/engineering-future-ges-goal-bridge-stem-gender-gap-2020\/\">50-50 gender ratio<\/a>\u00a0in its technical entry-level workforce by 2020. The company&#8217;s goal is to end the STEM gender gap that currently exists at GE by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/02\/08\/general-electric-gender-parity-workforce-by-2020\/\">hiring 5,000 more women<\/a>\u00a0in STEM roles in the next two years. The initiative will dramatically increase the representation of women in its engineering, IT, and product management roles.<\/p>\n<p>Along with these goals, GE also has publicly announced the goal of a 50-50 ratio in its technical leadership program, multi-year training courses that are expected to be a major producer of executives and leaders of the company in coming years. Along with the announcement of their commitments to gender parity in tech, GE also released a white paper including a variety of related stats that show how crucial gender parity solutions are to the future of tech innovation and success in the US. According to their results, women make up only\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ge.com\/reports\/engineering-future-ges-goal-bridge-stem-gender-gap-2020\/\">13 to 24 percent<\/a>\u00a0of tech-related jobs at major tech giants, and only 17 to 30 percent ascend to leadership positions. One especially eye-catching stat was that companies will need to hire\u00a0around 2 million women in engineering and computing jobs over the next ten years to solve the STEM gender gap.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, there is a lot of work yet to be done. GE&#8217;s announcement\u00a0came within the past year so while there are no results to show just yet, the very public announcement\u00a0is definitely a step forward\u00a0and it enables\u00a0a level of accountability on a major scale.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>And The Honorable Mentions Go To&#8230;<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<strong>Etsy.\u00a0<\/strong>Etsy is one of the few tech-based companies\u00a0with more female employees than male. The company&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.etsy.com\/news\/2016\/diversity-and-equality-at-etsy\/\">2016 Diversity Report<\/a>\u00a0showed women now make up 54 percent of its workforce, up from 51 percent in 2014. An even more impressive stat is that half of the leadership and management positions at Etsy belong to women, an almost unbelievable achievement in an industry known for its lack of female leadership. Additionally, the company announced they view\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/04\/29\/technology\/etsy-diversity-report\/index.html\">gender as a spectrum<\/a>\u00a0and welcome employees to select their gender identity from over 60 options embracing a non-binary way of looking and defining gender. However, the company has work to do in reaching equal representation of women in its engineering department,\u00a0which\u00a0is only\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2016\/04\/etsy-defying-techs-lousy-record-gender-diversity\/\">20.5 percent women<\/a>, along with prioritizing racial diversity, another widespread issue in the tech industry. It&#8217;s these issues that keep Etsy from\u00a0being on par with gender parity allies like Intel and GE.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Facebook and Microsoft.\u00a0<\/strong>While Facebook and Microsft have major work to do when it comes to equal representation of women on their tech teams, both companies announced in 2015 they had\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2016\/04\/11\/facebook-microsoft-gender-pay-gap\/#DUeh_ty5bZqg\">eliminated the gender pay gap<\/a>\u00a0among their male and female workers. Although both companies need to do much more to reach full gender parity in tech, the first step is providing equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_column_text]With recent initiatives like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.timesupnow.com\/\">Time&#8217;s Up<\/a>\u00a0and gender diversity goals being set by a variety of companies, it seems\u00a0full gender equality and gender parity are goals we may live to see fulfilled in not only tech but a wide array of industries.
