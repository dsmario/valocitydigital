Though, social automation helps your business post content on a consistent basis, over automation can create a barrier between your business and your audience. The challenge is to utilize these tools while also ensuring you have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbntimes.com\/en\/companies\/social-media-marketing-mistakes-to-avoid-part-1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">meaningful interactions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which will authenticate your online presence. If you&#8217;ve scheduled four posts for the day, make sure someone is following up with them, and responding to any comments, retweets, or shares from your consumers. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><i>Missing Out on Retargeting. <\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On average, a buyer makes <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.digitalstrategyconsulting.com\/intelligence\/2014\/11\/savvy_shoppers_make_9_visits_to_a_retailers_site_before_deciding_to_buy.php\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nine visits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to a retailer\u2019s site before deciding to make a purchase. It\u2019s crucial to spend time driving traffic to your site, but if you haven\u2019t implemented a retargeting campaign it&#8217;ll be hard to get visitors to make that ninth visit to your site. Retargeting ads will assist in attracting customers to return to your website by showing them highly-specific ads on both Facebook and Google. Not <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/digital-marketing\/5-common-digital-marketing-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them-02112681\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retargeting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a marketing mistake that can make you miss out on repeat visitors, which will then decrease your conversions, and hurt your bottom line. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><i>Tone-Deaf Social Posts. <\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today&#8217;s world, controversial news can become global trending topics in a matter of minutes. A huge marketing mistake is to try to make a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/33396\/8-of-the-biggest-marketing-faux-pas-of-all-time.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contentious situation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> humorous or profitable. Despite your good intentions, you\u2019re likely to come across as tone-deaf and insensitive. Your company has to realize that diversity initiatives and hiring practices that are sensitive to race, gender, and class can help your marketing initiatives. Having a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mondo.com\/blog-craft-an-inclusive-work-culture\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diverse team<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help ensure that you&#8217;re generating inclusive ideas, which can then assist with covering sensitive topics, and expanding your commercial reach to new audiences who will now better connect with your services and products. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><i>Ignoring Content You Already Have. <\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your marketing team may have the instinct to continuously churn out new content for your target audience. However, a common marketing mistake is just that, forgetting about the content you already have once it&#8217;s published. Evergreen content can enhance your company&#8217;s credibility, allowing your audience to see you as a thought leader of your industry. Though one of the most important benefits of evergreen content is the SEO a boost it brings. The higher your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.woorank.com\/en\/blog\/grow-your-seo-with-evergreen-content\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO ranking<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the more likely your content will appear at the top of searches. Re-sharing and utilizing this content can help expand audience reach and drive conversions. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><i><\/i><\/b><b><i>Lead Discrepancy. <\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes reports that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/paulpotratz\/2018\/09\/10\/common-marketing-mistakes-5-ways-to-ensure-youre-not-making-them\/#27db361516ae\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">65 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of businesses say lead generation is a problem for them yet most don&#8217;t realize they\u2019re experiencing lead discrepancy. When looking to uncover the root of their problem, most question the quality of the lead versus discovering if they are nurturing their leads. You must ensure that your team is properly trained and have a thorough process for the various types of leads your teams are driving. Essentially your team needs to know how to connect and track with every lead they may encounter, which will allow your company to successfully transform your leads into consumers, and revenue. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;0&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h2><b>How To Avoid These Marketing Mistakes<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making sure you&#8217;re aware of marketing mistakes that can have a damaging impact on your company&#8217;s reputation, target audience, and bottom line is an excellent step towards a perfect marketing strategy.
