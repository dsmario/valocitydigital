These professionals tend to come from a technical background within\u00a0development\u00a0with knowledge of Python and Java. They are able to get directly behind the code to identify any vulnerabilities and what patches they can make to minimize performance issues or cybersecurity risks. These are the individuals that protect your business from open-source software hacks. The average salary for an experience Cybersecurity Engineer ranges from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.payscale.com\/research\/US\/Job=Cyber_Security_Engineer\/Salary\">$90,000 to $140,000<\/a>.
