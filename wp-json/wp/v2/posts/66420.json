When misused these Tech advancements can be manipulated to create devastating cyberattacks, as we saw with the recent breach of TimeHop, which exposed the confidential data of more than <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/09\/timehop-discloses-july-4-data-breach-affecting-21-million\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">21 million users<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or the amplification of infrastructure-destroying cryptojacking and ransomware through <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.techrepublic.com\/article\/the-dirty-secret-about-bitcoin-its-amplifying-ransomware-cybercrime-and-more\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin mining<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Since integrating emerging tech like AI, AR, and IoT devices into your company&#8217;s operations is a crucial component to remain competitive, many businesses like yours are looking to improve their enterprise security and defend themselves against emerging threats. <\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;1&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Critical 2018 Cyberattacks<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In June, foreign cybercriminals hacked the U.S. Navy via a Navy contractor, obtaining <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/national-security\/china-hacked-a-navy-contractor-and-secured-a-trove-of-highly-sensitive-data-on-submarine-warfare\/2018\/06\/08\/6cc396fa-68e6-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.07cbce515d21\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">614 gigabytes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of sensitive military data. Though the exact nature of the attack is still under investigation, it\u2019s suspected that the information might have been stored on an unsecured network, making it an easy target for hackers. If these hackers were able to get their hands on highly classified military data, are your business&#8217;s networks secure enough to survive a similar hack?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another recent attack reported at the beginning of July was the breach of Ticketmaster, where <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/article\/ticketmaster-data-breach-monzo-inbenta\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40,000<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> customers\u2019 payment data, addresses, names, and phone numbers were exposed. Proving if the right enterprise security precautions aren&#8217;t met, companies like Ticketmaster and TimeHop, who incorporate AI tech in their services and outsource server needs to cloud providers, are unintentionally opening themselves to more vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals then use these weak spots to uncover consumer data, access confidential business information, and damage or destroy a company&#8217;s infrastructure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These attacks show that now is the best time for companies from every sector to rethink, recreate and refortify their enterprise security solutions.

With many industry experts predicting that emerging technologies will only increase, it&#8217;s safe to say the rate of cybercrimes will increase as well. In fact, the Washington Post predicts that cybercrimes will cost businesses over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news\/2018\/jul\/11\/syniverse-appoints-philip-celestini-chief-security\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$2 trillion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by 2019. To maintain the protection of your data and your bottom line, here are a few enterprise security solutions your business can implement to fortify your defenses:<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner column_width_percent=&#8221;90&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-key&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;color-210407&#8243;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Connecting the C-Suite &#8211; <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think you&#8217;d agree that one way to create safer enterprise security solutions is to make sure every employee fully understands potential threats and the resources necessary to deploy when facing these threats. However, recent studies show there\u2019s an apparent disconnect between those in the C-suite and those out in the field, regarding business threats. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.centrify.com\/about-us\/news\/press-releases\/2018\/centrify-study-finds-ceo-disconnect-is-weakening-cybersecurity\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">42 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the Technical Officers who participated in a recent Centrify study said identity breaches were the company&#8217;s primary threat. Despite this knowledge from the field, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbestechcouncil\/2018\/03\/21\/ceo-disconnect-on-cybersecurity-increases-risk-of-breaches\/#2bd5c4783e53\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">60 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the CEOs surveyed reported they were investing most in malware protection. It\u2019s crucial to ensure your CEO takes heed to those employees who have first-hand experience, while also encouraging all employees to effectively communicate security threats or risk facing irreparable damage to your company&#8217;s brand and reputation.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Identifying Internal Threats &#8211; <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though most businesses look outward when seeking to identify threats and create corresponding enterprise security solutions, recent research from the US Computer Emergency Response Team (US-CERT) found that employees are responsible for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/the-top-five-internal-security-threats\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of IT security breaches. If your business wants to protect its assets, you must start by identifying and disabling any possible internal threats. This is as easy as updating any company-wide acceptable use policies, and using the latest monitoring software to supervise emails, computer activity, and internet traffic for alarming keywords or compromised file types. In today&#8217;s ever-changing world you must ensure you are verifying and protecting against all possible threats to your company&#8217;s confidential information. From internal sources, as well as external. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Understanding Data Sensitivity Levels &#8211; <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you know, with the rise of emerging technologies, businesses are creating <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cisco.com\/c\/en\/us\/solutions\/collateral\/service-provider\/global-cloud-index-gci\/white-paper-c11-738085.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more data<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than ever before. Protecting this valuable asset is one of the main reasons why your business needs enhanced enterprise security. One solution your company can start practicing today is the importance of understanding your various sets of data have different sensitivity levels. You will need to craft more than one data security protocol because as Rashmi Knowles, EMEA field CTO for RSA Security, points out, companies that realize data solutions are not one-size-fits-all and understand the specific sensitivity levels of their different data can drastically <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/data-storage-and-access-policies-heres-what-you-need-to-think-about\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decrease risks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of internal misuse and guarantee that only employees who are required to handle sensitive information have access to it. In order to maximize data protection, you must ensure all employees understand and follow the latest data security protocols.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;0&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite many already having cybersecurity policies set, it&#8217;s clear that companies must reevaluate and adopt higher-level enterprise security solutions as cyberattacks continue to evolve and increase.
