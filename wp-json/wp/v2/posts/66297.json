Of course, you aren&#8217;t a small Mom and Pop business or a tiny Tech startup, so your employee&#8217;s computers likely have firewall and antivirus programs installed. However, only\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/tech\/news\/2017\/05\/21\/hate-automatic-software-updates-youre-not-alone\/101883500\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">35 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0of the Tech experts surveyed for a Google study on security procedures said updating and installing the latest patches were one of their top security practices. In the age of instant gratification, the study revealed that many of your employees may not update because they don&#8217;t want to be interrupted from their tasks. To protect your business data, you must develop and implement a patch plan, where your cybersecurity team can ensure all devices have downloaded the latest security patches available. Educating employees by having company-wide times set aside solely for downloading patches every 3 to 4 months will help your Tech company avoid getting hit by a\u00a0cyberattack, like the massive\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/tech\/news\/2017\/05\/15\/ransomeware-attack-wannacry-malware\/101710900\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WannaCry hack<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which targeted victims that failed to download the latest software update.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Provide Quarterly Company-Wide Cybersecurity Training.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0When recruiting cybersecurity talent your Tech business will, of course, want to onboard candidates who have the best track records for protecting data against ongoing\u00a0cyberattacks. In spite of this, it&#8217;s important to remember the technology fueling these attacks and your business\u2019s innovations are evolving constantly, which is why quarterly company-wide cybersecurity training is so necessary. If you are always providing your Tech specialists with the latest updates on offensive and defense tactics, your business is less likely to make a security mistake.

AI technology can power control systems, along with security video management, then process data from both. The data collected is then used to understand how resources are managed and where and if there are any vulnerabilities, saving businesses time and money. This emerging technology can be seen as an alternative for companies lacking the funds to onboard a full-time hire, yet still, need to increase their security efforts.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Create A Response Plan.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Data breaches and hacks can have a significant impact on a company\u2019s revenue, and the price only increases the bigger your Tech company is.

You should view your response plan as a critical component of your cybersecurity policy that will ensure your business can properly respond to a data breach. Response plans will help companies adequately secure stolen data, fix vulnerabilities and also notify the necessary individuals. The Federal Trade Commission reports that businesses with data breach response plans in place are less likely to experience hacks.
