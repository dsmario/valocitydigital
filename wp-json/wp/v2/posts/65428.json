Integrate this option to benefit from user-friendly design and an easy-to-use, intuitive interface.\u00a0The cost of the solution increases as your list of contacts grows, though, which can be a deterrent for\u00a0some companies based on their lead generation strategies or processes.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketo.com\/software\/marketing-automation\/\">Marketo<\/a>.<\/strong>\u00a0As the world leader in marketing automation for companies of all sizes, you can&#8217;t go wrong building a MarTech stack centered around Marketo&#8217;s marketing automation platform. With all the same capabilities offered by HubSpot, along with expanded native CRM integrations with Microsoft Dynamic CRM, Salesforce, and SAP CRM, Marketo has rapidly become the top choice for large, enterprise businesses focused on driving results, boosting efficiency, and increasing the ROI of their Digital Marketing strategies. This marketing automation platform is less user-friendly and intuitive to those new to it, but it offers the best value for your money out of the Martech solutions listed. Sales-driven companies interested in this option should consider hiring a Marketo Consultant or Marketo Expert to handle the integration of the platform and to train your current Marketing and Sales teams on how to best utilize it.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pardot.com\/\">Pardot<\/a>.\u00a0<\/strong>Another one of the top MarTech platforms for marketing automation is Salesforce&#8217;s Pardot.

Boasting all of the capabilities offered by Marketo, this solution can easily be used by both Marketers and sales reps in tandem to generate more pipeline and close more deals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>How To Identify The Right Platform For You<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Now that you&#8217;re familiar with the top MarTech platforms for marketing automation needs, it&#8217;s time to identify which one is right for you so you can make an informed purchase.
