Have you seen a big change in the industry during recent years?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MARIA:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The change that technology has had on advertising and marketing is tremendous. The iPhone, iPad, Facebook, and YouTube are some of the things that come to mind on how they have completely transformed the way we\u00a0consume media. In the case of advertising, the digitization of media has given us the ability to collect billions of data points from customers\u2019 devices, allowing us to better understand<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the consumer journey. With these new insights we have that much more information allowing us to better target consumers and the advertising they ingest on a daily basis.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<b>MONDO:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As SVP of Global Marketing how do you keep Mediaocean ahead of the curve?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MARIA:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I go about this in two ways. Most importantly I work to bring in the best talent possible. I\u2019m extremely honest about what my strengths and weaknesses are, and am constantly looking to hire people that are more qualified than I am in the areas where I\u2019m not so strong. It\u2019s important to bring people to the table who will balance the team and contribute where you personally cannot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m also very curious and try to keep up with all the new research, trends, and technologies in the industry. I try to instill the same thirst for curiosity in my team and always expect every project to start by conducting research on what\u2019s going on in the market. By doing this we continue to develop insight into our customer base and what they need, so we can better inform Mediaocean\u2019s marketing strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MONDO:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mediaocean prides itself on having 30% more female employees than other leading technology firms. How has this positively affected the company?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MARIA:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mediaocean strongly believes in the benefits of diversity in many forms: socioeconomic, gender, ethnicity, etc. Having a diverse team allows you to look at a problem from different angles, rather than all coming from the same place. When the workplace becomes homogenous the ideas become homogenous. Diversity gives you multiple windows to creativity and problem solving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MONDO:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s currently a conversation going on about bringing non-STEM educated minds into the technology world \u2013 for example those with more traditional liberal arts degrees. What are your thoughts on this trend?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MARIA:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no reason for any skill set to be mutually exclusive. Of course there are specific roles like Data Science or Engineering that need a technical education, but then you have positions like mine that require a completely different background and set of skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my case, I received my MA in Political Science and Public Opinion and started my career in market research. My program was rooted in sociology, which has given me a unique angle and perspective as a marketer. In addition to my Political Science degree, I have an MA in Media Studies. There\u2019s room for everyone in the industry, it\u2019s just a matter of finding the right role for you.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<b>MONDO:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you think is at the root of the gender gap in STEM fields?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MARIA:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s still a big underlying stereotype in gender roles for both men and women. It\u2019s not just an industry issue, but a societal one as well. Walk into any toy store and you\u2019ll see a row of totally separate toys for boys and girls. Society constantly tells us what\u2019s \u201cfeminine\u201d and what\u2019s \u201cmasculine,\u201d and unfortunately that sticks with a lot of people when they\u2019re picking an education or career path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re currently going through the process of changing this, and although we\u2019re making great progress there\u2019s still a long way to go. It\u2019s great that we\u2019re having this conversation and starting to question gender stereotypes on both sides in order to challenge them head on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MONDO:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is Mediaocean working to combat the gender gap in technology?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MARIA:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mediaocean allows its employees a level of flexibility not offered at many other companies, meaning women are able to come back after maternity leave and successfully balance work and home.\u00a0This is a particular time when you see a huge mid-career drop off of women leaving the tech industry once they have children, and companies need to work around that in order to keep them in the field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike many companies, Mediaocean doesn\u2019t set standard 9-5 work hours that all employees must adhere by. For example, people on my team may need to occasionally work late or come in on weekends, but also know that if something comes up on a weekday, it\u2019s not a problem. I expect my team to work hard and get the job done, but understand the complicated schedule that arises when you have a family. I would never make someone feel uncomfortable asking for a Tuesday afternoon off to attend their child\u2019s doctors appointment or parent\/teacher meeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MONDO:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mediaocean just launched an incredible <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/wit.mediaocean.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women in Technology scholarship program<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that grants three, $25,000 scholarships to women in the STEM fields. How did this start?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MARIA:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our CEO, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediaocean.com\/leadership\/ceo\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bill Wise<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, has two daughters who are 10 and 14, and a son who is 16 who knows how to code. One day he came to work and shared that he couldn\u2019t find anyone to teach his daughters coding. Unfortunately this isn\u2019t a unique situation in today\u2019s technology world, and we wanted to do something about that. We created the program as a way to see what a medium sized business could do to create change bigger than ourselves.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<b>MONDO:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you hope for the program to accomplish?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MARIA:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through direct action we\u2019re helping three women to achieve their dreams, but hope to take it further than that. 60 percent of people we surveyed believe there isn\u2019t enough social support for women in technology. We\u2019re hoping that by saying \u201cwe support you\u201d to these three women, those women will turn around and support others, and so on and so forth. Hopefully one day they\u2019ll inspire other women to pursue a STEM career.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MONDO:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of role models, who are some women in technology that inspire you? How are they working to close the gender gap?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>MARIA:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The people I admire the most are women entrepreneurs who are relentlessly working to start their own companies. Debbie Sterling from GoldieBlox, ShelIey Zallis of the Girls Lounge, Payal Kadakia of Class Pass, and many other women who are coming up with new business ideas and building businesses from the ground up to be profoundly inspiring. It takes a lot of guts to start your own business, particularly as a woman in very masculine industries.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243;
