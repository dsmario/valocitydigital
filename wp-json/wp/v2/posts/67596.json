The Agent of Excellence is someone who exemplifies what it means to be an Agent of Change, lives and breathes MAP, drives innovation, and helps shape our Mondo culture. Here\u2019s a look at what we learned by sitting down with this month\u2019s first dual Agents of Excellence, Eric Cox &amp; Scott Pano of Mondo finance.<\/span>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since joining Mondo, both Eric and Scott have dived head first into its culture and became instrumental in helping Mondo&#8217;s finance team streamline its day-to-day operations. They have been vital players during the company&#8217;s Addison Group acquisition process, with both of them taking on more responsibilities and making it a stress-free process for the rest of Mondo Nation. By holding themselves, and their team accountable, Eric and Scott have seen continued success throughout their tenure at Mondo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out the following Q&amp;A to learn more about Eric and Scott, their experience working at Mondo, and what they love most about their respective roles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What makes Mondo stand out compared to your previous employers?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>EC<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; \u201cWell, since graduating college, I had only worked at one other company. For me, the experiences are night and day. There the hard work wasn\u2019t truly rewarded; perhaps you\u2019d get a pat on the back here and there but really you were expected to put in a lot of time. Coming here, the culture is all about working hard but teaches you that people always come first. Mondo has shown me that a company can genuinely care for its employees.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>SP<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; \u201cI worked at another company for 8 months before coming to Mondo, so I don\u2019t have much to add but I\u2019d say it differs because Mondo is such a faster-paced company. Here you can actually drive change, unlike most companies that are stuck in their ways. If you have an idea or find a new efficient way to do something, everyone will stop to hear you out.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What is your favorite thing about working at Mondo?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>SP &#8211; <\/b>\u201c<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think for me it\u2019s the ability to always learn new things at such a fast-paced company. I love that there\u2019s always room for growth, and the culture!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>EC<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; \u201cI would say my favorite thing about working at Mondo is that if you put in the effort, the work, and the time, it will never go unnoticed. You will always reap the rewards of your work, and I think that\u2019s all you can really ask for from a company or your career.\u201d<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading]<\/p>\n<h3><b>Here\u2019s how Eric &amp; Scott described the Boston office:<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-calculator&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Driven\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tested\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resilient <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;3&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1560875791387{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_single_image media=&#8221;67598&#8243; media_width_percent=&#8221;100&#8243; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; position_vertical=&#8221;middle&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1560875798757{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]<b>How has Mondo helped you become the professional you are today?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>EC &#8211; <\/b>\u201c<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ll speak a little bit for both of us, we both started at Mondo when we were still pretty new in our careers. Mondo has helped us grow professionally by providing the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of corporate-financing, what it means to be accountable, and what it means to be a part of a company. Mondo has provided a lot of professional opportunities that other companies wouldn\u2019t.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>SP &#8211; <\/b>\u201c<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I\u2019d say that Mondo has provided me with the challenges that have helped my career grow. The company has let me move around within the finance department and learn the ins and outs of each role on our team. At Mondo, I\u2019m able to learn about every facet of finance and accounting.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<b>EC &#8211; <\/b>\u201c<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ll add here, at a more general level, Mondo has really taught me the importance of accountability and how that plays out in the growth of any profession.

Mentality means coming into work, liking what you do, and knowing that if you put in the work the results will always follow. Accountability, is the most applicable one to us in finance, and is something we\u2019ve been teaching at Mondo for years. People make mistakes, so all you can do is own them and learn from them. Then process is following the right things to do and trusting that others will do their part, and the pieces will all come together and work out.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>SP &#8211; <\/b>\u201c<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So for me, mentality is to put your head down, work as hard as you can, and let your work speak for itself and people will recognize it. Accountability, is all about holding yourself accountable as well as everyone around you. It\u2019s all about learning from your mistakes. Lastly for process, all you need is to trust the process; believe in the company; believe in Stephanie\u2019s vision and contribute in every way you can.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What does being an Agent of Excellence mean to you?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>EC &#8211; <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u201cBeing named the Agent of Excellence means a lot. Mondo has some of the most talented people that i\u2019ve ever worked with. There are just so many motivated people here, who have accomplished so much, so to be awarded this title is just a huge compliment. This award is proof that even at a sales-driven company like Mondo, our back-end work is still noticed.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>SP &#8211; <\/b>\u201c<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I don\u2019t want to completely reiterate what Eric just said but it does mean a lot to me,despite the fact that not everyone can always see our work first-hand, that it\u2019s still being noticed. So many people have messaged me, pinged me, came up to me with their congratulations so that has really solidified that everyone appreciates us and sees our efforts.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Scott &amp; Eric have clearly found success by being champions of Mondo\u2019s core values and its people-centric culture. Accountability in particular seems to be a tool that has helped both of them become valuable assets for the business. Both Eric and Scott are proof that when you put your people first, your business will always succeed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Congrats to Eric and Scott on being named this month\u2019s Agents of Excellence! They have worked hard and earned this recognition.
