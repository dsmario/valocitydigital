Since driving qualified leads into the marketing funnel is a top priority, it makes sense that 82% of marketers are planning to increase the use of customer data generated from their customer\u2019s behaviors to improve the user experience (UX), according to our latest Digital Marketing Survey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The fact that so many marketing professionals are planning to increase the use of this data goes to show how much untapped potential lies in customer data. Yet, many businesses are still unsure of how to best track, analyze, and utilize their customer data. Based on insights and data gathered from our Digital Marketing Survey and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/dm-salary-guide-2016-download\/\">Digital Marketing Salary Guide<\/a>, here&#8217;s a look at the common problems businesses face when tracking and analyzing customer data and a few solutions on how to optimize the data your business has access to:<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>Building Awareness:<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Many businesses have customer data that is going to waste because they\u2019re either unaware of the depth of detail to their current reporting, or the reporting strategy hasn\u2019t evolved with advancing technology. In both situations, the opportunity to fully break down the path and experience of the customer is absent.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This gap between awareness and execution is what\u2019s holding you back from crafting a clear customer identity and defining each step in their experience. Review your marketing funnel and align your available reporting to identify where any data shortages exist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Since each business is different, selecting a software can also pose a challenge. What used to stop at page traffic, bounce rates, content sharing, and landing page conversions, now goes much deeper. Popular matrices being tracked and measured are things like; heat mapping, A\/B testing, link tracking, demographics, social sharing, and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It&#8217;s important to understand how and where your customers engage with your brand, which is why\u00a0behavioral tracking was cited as the top priority for marketers moving forward. Many businesses need to use multiple tools to ensure they are tracking the right attributes. Let the data inform the customer personas based on their behaviors to create curated content, enhance and personalize the UX, and boost conversions.
