This is especially true for IT\/Tech contract or freelance professionals since the computer\/information systems industry currently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/15\/us\/remote-workers-work-from-home.html\">ranks second<\/a> in industries embracing remote work. In 2016, 57 percent of employees working in computer\/information systems spent some of their time working remotely, according to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gallup.com\/reports\/199961\/state-american-workplace-report-2017.aspx\">report on workplace findings<\/a> by Gallup.<\/p>\n<p>Along with changing workplace expectations, there are a variety of components that have led to the rise in remote work in IT and Tech. As more and more highly specialized Tech professionals demand flexibility when it comes to their work schedule and location, companies will be forced to reconsider their traditional policies.\u00a0Let&#8217;s explore the evolution of remote work, the benefits of hiring remote employees for your IT\/Tech needs, and the secret to making it successful.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>The Evolution of Remote Work<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]The idea of telecommuting and remote employees has been around for a while, but only lately has technology allowed these possibilities to be considered by companies of all sizes across all industries. Innovative companies like Trello and GitHub have implemented remote policies of their own to capitalize on the growing pool of high-end, niche IT and Tech contract and freelance professionals and attract top talent.<\/p>\n<p>Because technology has allowed work environments to become more flexible and customizable, top Tech and IT specialists are demanding more flexibility for themselves. Forward-thinking IT and Tech companies are jumping on the opportunity considering the cost of living in top Tech hotbeds, like New York City and San Francisco, is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/04\/06\/san-francisco-cost-of-living-pricing-out-tech-companies-workers.html\">pricing out<\/a> the Tech experts looking to move there and find work; meaning companies located here must explore creative alternatives to the finite resource of local talent.<\/p>\n<p>Execs are moving away from the more traditional ways of operating and expanding their options to include more remote opportunities and work flexibility because it&#8217;s a win-win. Companies get the top talent available while saving on various costs and employees get to work when and where they want, while eliminating the challenge of commuting, which in top hotbeds like NYC or San Fran can add anywhere from 6 to 15 hours onto their work week.<\/p>\n<p>Remote work isn&#8217;t just convenient for both employers and employees, but studies have shown that it&#8217;s also more effective. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/15\/us\/remote-workers-work-from-home.html\">Gallup&#8217;s report<\/a>, employees across various industries who spent 60 to 80 percent of their time working remotely had the highest rates of engagement. As execs become more comfortable with the idea that work is fluid and can happen anywhere at any time, they come to realize that simply having a body to fill a seat\u00a0for the sake of doing so is no longer worth the expense, nor is it effective in accomplishing goals.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Benefits of Hiring Remote\u00a0IT\/Tech\u00a0Professionals<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]While there are a variety of reasons businesses turn to remote\u00a0workers,\u00a0here&#8217;s a look at the top benefits of hiring remote\u00a0IT\/Tech professionals:[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Access otherwise unreachable talent. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important and impactful benefit of hiring remote talent is the ability to access otherwise unreachable talent. If you lack the talent you need in your area, you can access it via remote contracts. Rather than paying to relocate a Tech expert to your area, save on those costs and instead hire them as a remote employee, expanding the reach of your talent nationally or even globally.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Boost creativity and productivity. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All those meetings you&#8217;re having?

There are four key components to doing so: Clear communication, trust, flexibility, and company culture.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/biz30.timedoctor.com\/enhance-team-communication\/\">Consistent communication<\/a> is crucial to leading a remote team effectively. Creating a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbeshumanresourcescouncil\/2017\/04\/13\/10-critical-demands-managers-face-and-how-hr-can-help\/#613285955bac\">clear communication schedule<\/a> and setting aside face-to-face time via video calls help keep the team connected, collaborating, and on schedule. Additionally, trust and remote work go hand in hand. To provide remote work opportunities to your employees, you have to trust them. Providing them with the autonomy they want through remote work or telecommuting policies will\u00a0clearly showcase that you trust them to do their work, which allows them to do their best work.<\/p>\n<p>For remote work to function properly, companies must be flexible. Various startups like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wework.com\/\">WeWork<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remoteyear.com\/\">Remote Year<\/a> are popping up and providing businesses and employees with innovative options to make remote work even more effective, like providing office spaces for remote workers looking to collaborate with coworkers or allowing employees to travel to different cities to work out of so they don&#8217;t have to choose between travel and work. Last but not least, creating a strong company culture must be a priority. Establishing a culture that connects remote employees and builds relationships between them, despite the physical distance, can be the deciding factor\u00a0behind the quality of work they present.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;1&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Looking Ahead<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]The rising trend of remote work at Tech companies shows no signs of slowing down.
