However, your lengthy hiring process could be negatively impacting your ability to hire the Tech and Digital Marketing talent you&#8217;re after. The average length of the job interview process in the US sits at 23.8 days, according to Glassdoor&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/research\/time-to-hire-in-25-countries\/\">2017 analysis<\/a>, up from only\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3048421\/why-the-hiring-process-takes-longer-than-ever\">13 days<\/a>\u00a0in 2011. And that&#8217;s just the national average. A 2015 Deloitte study found that it took, on average,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/content\/dam\/Deloitte\/us\/Documents\/manufacturing\/us-manufacturing-industrial-products-09302014.pdf\">94 days<\/a>\u00a0to recruit for highly skilled Tech roles.\u00a0If your hiring process\u00a0lasts\u00a0several weeks or longer, it&#8217;s time to reevaluate it.\u00a0Discover the benefits of hiring faster and learn why speed is crucial to netting your teams the hires they need.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>The Top Benefits of Hiring Faster<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner column_width_percent=&#8221;90&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-plus&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;color-210407&#8243;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Save on Costs &amp; Resources.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the top benefits of hiring faster is\u00a0the money and valuable resources your business will save. Shortening the length of your hiring process reduces the amount of time hiring managers and HR or hiring departments have to spend recruiting, researching,\u00a0and screening candidates. It also limits the amount of time hiring managers and team members\u00a0that work directly with the available role have to spend interviewing, which, as we all know, is valuable time spent away from their day-to-day responsibilities. There&#8217;s also the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbestechcouncil\/2017\/06\/22\/the-price-of-vacancy-the-cost-of-unfilled-technology-jobs\/#5675b3045747\">ongoing cost<\/a>\u00a0of your unfilled role to consider. Depending on the role, you may have to supplement the\u00a0vacancy by expanding the workloads of your\u00a0other employees, outsourcing to freelancers, or pushing back releases of new software or products; Costing your business revenue and money. By hiring faster, you&#8217;ll save on valuable resources, like your hiring managers time, and the costs associated with the vacant role.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Access to Higher Quality Hires.\u00a0<\/strong>Highly qualified talent isn&#8217;t on the market for long, especially when it comes to in-demand Digital Marketing and Tech professionals. A common problem\u00a0many hiring managers and departments face is that by the time the decision is made, and a candidate is fully approved and cleared, the candidate is no longer interested or available due to increased demand for their niche skill sets.\u00a0Having a longer\u00a0interview process means\u00a0you risk losing the high-end candidates you&#8217;re interested\u00a0in to\u00a0other opportunities. Limiting the interview process to a few days or weeks rather than a month or longer ensures the\u00a0high-quality talent you&#8217;re most interested in is still available once the final decision is made.<\/li>\n<li><b>Potentially Higher Acceptance Rates.\u00a0<\/b>Along with access to higher quality hires, another one of the top benefits of hiring faster is potentially higher acceptance rates from candidates. The faster and more efficient your hiring process, the\u00a0fewer offers you&#8217;ll have to compete with to land the high-end Digital Marketing or Tech expert you want. If they don&#8217;t have time to interview\u00a0or\u00a0explore opportunities elsewhere during the hiring process, then they&#8217;ll be more likely to accept the job offer you extend. While a longer hiring process will give the decision makers at your business more time to fully agree on a hire,\u00a0it could\u00a0result in more back and forth with the candidate in terms of negotiations\u00a0or a rejected job offer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Net High-End Talent Faster.<\/strong>\u00a0When it comes down to it, your available Tech or Digital Marketing role is often an immediate need, which means you can&#8217;t\u00a0afford the 23 to 90 days your hiring process entails to fill the vacancy. By hiring faster, you&#8217;ll be able to net the high-end, in-demand talent you need as soon as you need it, rather than months after the\u00a0role becomes available. This urgency is especially crucial\u00a0with hiring needs\u00a0for Tech-related projects or Digital Marketing campaigns\u00a0that often have preset deadlines or launch dates\u00a0with no room for delays.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_column_text]While additional screening elements have lengthened the hiring process of companies across the board, there are invaluable benefits to prioritizing speed when it comes to\u00a0filling in-demand Tech and Digital Marketing roles.
