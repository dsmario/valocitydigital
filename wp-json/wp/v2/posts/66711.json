The Agent of Excellence is someone who exemplifies what it means to be an Agent of Change, lives and breathes MAP, drives innovation, and helps shape our Mondo culture. Here\u2019s a look at what we learned by sitting down with this month\u2019s Agent of Excellence, Jazmine Washington.<\/span>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One year ago, Jazmine joined Mondo as the first Technical Recruiter(TR) to join our revamped Dallas office. Although Jazmine excelled as a TR she eventually voiced her interest and growing passion for the sales side of our business. Fast forward to a year later and Jazmine has made the difficult transition from TR to Account Director(AD) look effortless and seamless by hitting her numbers and closing deals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cJazmine, aka &#8220;Queen Jaz&#8221;, from day one has proven to be a leader &amp; role model for the Dallas team and Mondo as a whole by encompassing MAP day-in, day-out.\u201d &#8211; Jules Young, Territory Sales Manager, Dallas<\/p>\n<p>Check out the following Q&amp;A to learn more about Jazmine, her experience, and what she values most about working at Mondo.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1534174652384{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_single_image media=&#8221;66723&#8243; caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; media_width_percent=&#8221;100&#8243; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; position_vertical=&#8221;middle&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1534174644903{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_column_text]<b>Based on your experience as an AD, what advice would you give to new employees just joining the Sales team at Mondo?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask questions and don\u2019t be afraid to fail. I think when I started I was terrified of making mistakes. From a sales perspective, you have to expect those no\u2019s and be prepared to overcome them. There will be a second chance, there will be other opportunities, and you\u2019re always going to be able to learn and then share that knowledge with everyone else on your team. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>After the time you\u2019ve spent here at Mondo, what keeps you motivated every day at Mondo?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wanting to find success every day is what brings me to the office.

As someone who has taken on multiple roles, Jazmine thrives when she is given the chance to be creative and take on new, challenging opportunities. She finished our conversation by leaving me with this: \u201cTo me being the Agent Of Excellence means I am a catalyst for success. I can show that when things don\u2019t seem possible, they are, and that there are several opportunities in every role here at Mondo. Since I&#8217;ve been on both sides of our business, the opportunity is there for everyone willing to do the work. The Agent Of Excellence is an example of how others can become a catalyst for change, assets to their office, and create personal and professional growth.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Congrats to Jazmine on being named the Agent of Excellence!
