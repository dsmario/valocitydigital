We know the struggle. While you could argue the talent gaps are to blame (and they probably are part of the issue), the real problem could be your employer branding. In fact, competitors with positive employer brands net twice as many applicants as businesses with negative employer brands, according to an\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterteam.com\/blog\/employer-branding\">analysis<\/a>\u00a0by Betterteam.<\/p>\n<p>Avoid a hiring panic by learning from the best of the best when it comes to employer branding and following the insights we&#8217;ve uncovered after 17 years in the staffing and recruiting industry.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>Is Employer Branding Really That Important?<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]For those who don&#8217;t know, employer branding, unlike consumer branding, focuses solely on promoting a business as the employer of choice for a targeted talent group the company wants to recruit and retain.<\/p>\n<p>In an age of job-networking sites like LinkedIn with thousands of daily applicants, expansive internal recruiting teams, and external recruitment and staffing services (yes, we are talking about ourselves here), many businesses simply don&#8217;t prioritize employer branding because they don&#8217;t see the ROI it offers.<\/p>\n<p>So, is employer branding really that essential to\u00a0get\u00a0you the talent you need? In short, absolutely.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experienced recruiters across our ten nationwide offices have difficulty filling positions with\u00a0high-end\u00a0talent for companies with a negative employer brand. When asked about the challenges faced when filling these types of roles, Shalom Berkowitz, the Lead Technical Recruiter in Mondo\u2019s NYC Headquarters, said the main challenge \u201cis the sell to the candidate.\u201d He continued, \u201cIf employers have a negative brand, then people are well aware, even candidates that are interviewing. Because of that reason, they do research, they go through Glassdoor, and they\u2019ll tell us they think the company has the wrong or negative brand, so they don\u2019t want to continue to pursue that role.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies with a negative reputation or poor employer brand should expect to spend at least 10 percent more per hire, according to a\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/03\/a-bad-reputation-costs-company-at-least-10-more-per-hire\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0by the Harvard Business Review and ICM Unlimited. Think about it this way: If you have 10,000 employees, you will then need to spend as much as $7.6 million in additional salaries to make up for your negative employer brand. And most often, increasing the salary to\u00a0net\u00a0the talent you want won\u2019t be enough. When asked about his experience with high-end candidates being offered higher salaries to accept positions for negative brands, Berkowitz said, \u201cWhile more money could help, it usually doesn\u2019t win over the candidate.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a strong employer brand, on the other hand, results in an increase in the quality of hires by\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eremedia.com\/tlnt\/bad-recruiting-it-can-cost-your-company-a-whole-lot-of-money\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to a CEB study. Which means the most qualified applicants will always prefer employers who showcase they are a business worth working for\u00a0through employer branding, even if that means taking a pay cut. Berkowitz discussed seeing this happen in some of the roles he\u2019s worked on, \u201cThere have been times where the employer has come back with a lower rate and the candidate\u2019s willing to take it because they understand that they\u2019ll be working with a great team, there\u2019s room for growth, and they just really want to work for the company.\u201d He continued, \u201c I recently had that happen with a popular music-based company. Because of the employer brand and because of the team, the candidate was willing to sacrifice on certain things because he really wanted to work there.\u201d<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Learn From The Best<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]The first step in identifying how to step-up your employer branding game is to look at what the best companies are doing. LinkedIn recently announced their global list of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/talent-solutions\/blog\/employer-brand\/2017\/top-companies-2017-ranking\">2017\u00a0Top Companies<\/a>\u00a0for employment determined by how well-known each business is, how much interaction their content receives on the platform, how much interest their job postings generate, and how well they retain new hires.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the US, the top seven companies in order of rank are Alphabet (Owner of Google), Amazon, Facebook, Salesforce, Uber, Tesla, and Apple. It&#8217;s no surprise that more than half of the top 50 companies are made up of tech-based organizations since they are at the forefront of innovation, are newer, and have focused on building a strong, unique employer brand that attracts top applicants. But how have they built such strong employer brands?

Their commitment to company culture has. Their oft-discussed &#8220;20% time&#8221; policy, where employees can devote 20 percent of their time to being creative rather than task-focused, coupled with their renewed focus as of late to drive out an apparent bro-centric atmosphere proliferating in Silicon Valley, and their exhaustive\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/careers.google.com\/\">Google Careers<\/a>\u00a0page which speaks to each individual applicant have all worked together to build a brand\u00a0everyone wants to work for.<\/li>\n<li><strong><b>Salesforce.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ranked fourth in LinkedIn&#8217;s Top Companies list, Salesforce has brilliantly focused on their employer branding strategy from the beginning. The company has attracted unparalleled Tech talent thanks to their commitment to an inclusive, equal, and philanthropic-driven culture, which is evidenced by the thousands of positive reviews referencing it on their\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/Reviews\/Salesforce-Reviews-E11159.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glassdoor page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

But there are employer branding tips you can steal from these Tech industry giants. Take a look at a few of the favorites we&#8217;ve implemented here at Mondo\u00a0that resulted in immediate, positive impacts on our employer branding:[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner column_width_percent=&#8221;90&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list]<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Collaborate on employer brand ownership.<\/strong>\u00a0A key\u00a0hurdle preventing businesses of all sizes from having a successful employer branding strategy is a miscommunication over who should own it. HR tends to think they do, the CEO thinks it&#8217;s their brand, so their\u00a0responsibility,\u00a0and Marketing handles social (AKA a key channel to communicate your employer brand), so they will need to be involved as well. Rather than forcing it on one department, have regular communication and collaboration between departments on employer branding efforts. Have the CEO dictate core elements\u00a0to\u00a0be communicated, HR provide what current applicants are looking for, and Marketing present these details through social media, ad, and employee-based strategies.<\/li>\n<li><b>Incorporate current employees.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterteam.com\/blog\/employer-branding\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0of people trust what employees say over brand ads. In that sense, what employees are saying about your business on your Glassdoor page or elsewhere online is extremely important. Michael Meade, an experienced Technical Recruiter II in our NYC Headquarters, has seen this firsthand. \u201cI\u2019ve had highly qualified candidates pull themselves for an opportunity after an interview or initial research of the company where they found negative reviews,\u201d reports Meade. Which exemplifies why both Google and Salesforce incorporate employee engagement in their employer branding. They showcase unique employee experiences and perspectives via video content, Instagram posts, and Tweets that provide real-life examples of why their employees love where they work and encourage them to leave reviews on company social and Glassdoor pages. Your internal employees are a free, invaluable resource in elevating a generic employee branding strategy.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Increase interest in job postings.<\/strong>\u00a0Stop posting redundant, run-of-the-mill job postings. You should\u00a0market your brand as a generic place to work by using the same repetitive job posting templates as everyone else. Review your job descriptions and identify where you can infuse interesting aspects of company culture to help make them stand out.<\/li>\n<li><b>Integrate retention resources.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From Day 1 for a new hire, the priority should be to provide them with the resources they need, so they stay with you as long as possible, along with improving the retention rates of your current employees. Retention is a key indicator of the inside workings and culture of any business, which Meade sees firsthand when recruiting. \u201cA lot of times, the reasons candidates pass on an opportunity are solely based on negative reviews and the turnover rate at a company,\u201d says Meade. To boost retention and improve your employer brand, identify how to make the new-hire transition smoother, provide professional development opportunities, highlight internal career advancements, and prioritize hiring within. All of these elements will add to your employer brand and instill a sense of loyalty and respect among your employees to the business.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]You have more control over your employer brand than you may have realized. It&#8217;s more important now than ever before to ensure your employer brand is in-line with how you and your employees see your business, or you could end up with a culture crisis on your hands like Uber and a reluctance from top talent to apply for any available positions. Follow the professionals when it comes to implementing an effective employer branding strategy and the tips we&#8217;ve outlined above, and you&#8217;ll be surprised to see the impact it has on your ability to attract and retain the talent you&#8217;re lacking.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re having difficulty attracting the high-end, niche IT, Tech, or Digital Marketing talent your business needs,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/mondo.com\/contact\/\">contact Mondo<\/a>\u00a0today.
