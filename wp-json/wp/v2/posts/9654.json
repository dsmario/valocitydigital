Innovative marketers must keep an eye on what&#8217;s new and trending in social media and incorporate\u00a0these new ways of connecting into their strategy to remain competitive and relevant. Based on insights and data gathered from our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/dm-salary-guide-2016-download\/\">Digital Marketing Salary Guide<\/a>,\u00a0we&#8217;ve discovered the latest social media development is live streaming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">This brand new offering represents the evolution of consumable social media content. Users love it because it\u2019s a rare look at organic, unplanned, honest content from the businesses, brands, and influencers they support. Innovative marketers see the opportunity it provides them with to make a more meaningful connection with direct feedback.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Despite the infancy of live streaming video, its rate of user adoption and participation from two major social media giants is driving the urgency to include this in marketing strategies now. Facebook just launched its own version of live streaming video for users and Twitter recently acquired the live streaming platform, Periscope. While it\u2019s safe to say that live streaming video is here to stay, now is the time to define how to best use this forum to build awareness and expand your reach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Here\u2019s a look at the social platforms that incorporate this feature that marketers should begin to experiment with, along with the roles businesses must have internally to begin producing content for the live streaming audience:<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<b>Periscope:<\/b>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/\">Periscope<\/a> is one of the earliest platforms to provide live streaming video. Recently acquired by Twitter, it\u2019s clear that there are big expectations and plans for this social media platform and what live streaming can offer both marketers and consumers. Marketers considering adding this platform to their social media strategy should note that it works best for growing audience size and boosting conversions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Since it was acquired by Twitter, users can now easily broadcast to both their Periscope and Twitter followers simultaneously, enabling marketers to be more strategic with their content and delivery. In terms of reach and consumption, there are currently over 30 million users, and these individuals watch a combined 110 years worth of live video daily. To date, there have been more than 200 million live streaming broadcasts on this platform.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<b>Facebook:<\/b>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Facebook\u2019s live streaming option, <a href=\"https:\/\/live.fb.com\/\">Live<\/a>, is arguably the most well-thought out live streaming video offering currently available. Seamlessly built into Facebook\u2019s current app, users can easily start live broadcasting to their friends and followers without leaving the app. Facebook claims it\u2019s the best way for users to interact with viewers in real time since it allows viewers to ask questions and react to the broadcast as it\u2019s happening, which Periscope also does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook Live is outperforming competitors in both reach and consumption. By changing privacy settings to public, marketers can stream content that is accessible to all 1.65 billion Facebook users. Unlike Periscope, there is no expiration on Live posts so marketers can turn their live streams into evergreen content, like Facebook video ads or living posts for consumers to continue to engage with and view.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With over 5.7 billion views on its current live broadcasts, Facebook\u2019s Live is proving to be the next channel marketers are turning to in an effort to boost traffic, conversions, and engagement.<\/span><\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>The Talent You&#8217;ll Need:<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Now that you&#8217;re versed in the top platforms for live streaming, you must evaluate whether you have the talent your business needs to begin producing successful content for this audience.
