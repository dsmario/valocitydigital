These security flaws affect almost all processors produced since 1995, so yes, every laptop, desktop, or smartphone you\u00a0use is at risk.<\/p>\n<p>Meltdown &#8220;basically melts security boundaries which are normally enforced by the hardware,&#8221; while Spectre &#8220;breaks the isolation between different applications&#8221; which gives hackers the ability &#8220;to trick error-free programs, which follow best practices, into leaking their secrets,&#8221;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/meltdownattack.com\/\">according to researchers<\/a>. Translation: These vulnerabilities can be exploited by hackers to steal sensitive data, like passwords, from your computer. Spectre is even worse because it&#8217;s a threat to smartphones as well as major\u00a0server-based cloud providers since it may allow hackers, posing as customers, to steal information from virtual neighbors\u00a0hosted on the same server.<\/p>\n<p>The major things to know are that Meltdown can be mostly mitigated through software patches that major Tech giants, like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, are rapidly pushing out.\u00a0However, only some exploitations of Spectre can be stopped by patches, which means new hardware may be necessary to guarantee security. It&#8217;s also likely Spectre will continue to be exploited for years to come given the fact that it offers various avenues of attack.

The performance impact is highly dependent on your hardware, operating system, and workload. So, while\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/thomasbrewster\/2018\/01\/10\/intel-microsoft-linux-slowdown-after-meltdown-spectre-updates\/#5ba4c5cc447b\">reports<\/a>\u00a0that the average computer user shouldn&#8217;t experience noticeable slowdowns\u00a0may be true for newer devices, computers with chips dating back to 2015 or older will\u00a0slow down &#8220;significantly,&#8221;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/01\/09\/microsoft-says-meltdown-and-spectre-fixes-will-slow-some-pcs-down-significantly.html\">according to Microsoft<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>However, businesses running large-scale, heavy workloads, like virtualization and data center\/cloud workloads, on their servers should expect a significant performance impact.

Review the security measures these providers follow and put pressure on them to ensure your business is protected.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Evaluate the data you need.<\/strong>\u00a0Companies today amass a wealth of data on everything from website traffic to specific\u00a0consumer and employee information, like addresses, credit cards, social security numbers, and more. Evaluate which data you actively utilize and if there is any data being collected simply because it always has been. Reducing the amount of sensitive data stored on offsite servers through cloud providers minimizes the\u00a0risk that hackers will be able to access that data\u00a0by exploiting Spectre vulnerabilities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hire cybersecurity talent. <\/strong>If you haven&#8217;t already, now is the time to expand your cybersecurity team.\u00a0Cybersecurity is by far the most invaluable Tech skill set for businesses considering the rise in massive, wide-spread\u00a0cyberattacks, security flaws, and increased reliance on vulnerable service providers in recent years. Hiring the right cybersecurity talent\u00a0is an investment that will likely provide the highest ROI out of any new hire in the years to come.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]Although there aren&#8217;t many solutions at the moment of how to minimize the performance impact of the patches on devices with heavy workloads, it&#8217;s crucial to start putting the security of these devices ahead of performance. In fact, it was the Tech industry&#8217;s insistence on putting performance ahead of security throughout the past two decades that resulted in Meltdown and Spectre, according to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/business\/21734482-even-if-hackers-do-not-exploit-two-new-chip-flaws-there-will-be-economic-consequences-spectre\">Paul Kocher<\/a>, one of the researchers who\u00a0discovered the vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n<p>One thing made clear through the discovery of these security flaws is that the current standards of security in the Tech industry are dismal at best, which is why having a highly qualified cybersecurity team has never been more crucial.
