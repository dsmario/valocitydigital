It determined the rankings by assigning cities an index of one to 100, 100 being the best possible score, based on four metrics: the gender pay gap in Tech, income after housing costs, women as a percentage of the Tech workforce, and four-year Tech employment growth.<\/p>\n<p>For companies looking to net more diverse, high-end Tech talent, these are the cities where you&#8217;ll find the most qualified female Tech professionals in the country. For women in Tech looking to escape exclusionary work environments or unbalanced pay scales found in major Tech hotbeds (looking at you, Silicon Valley), consider a career move to one of these ten cities.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>The Best Cities for Women in Tech<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner column_width_percent=&#8221;90&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-map-pin2&#8243; icon_color=&#8221;color-210407&#8243;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Washington, D.C. |\u00a0Index Score: 88.18<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>D.C. continues to rank as the best city for women in Tech. This is the third year the city has been awarded the ranking by Smart Asset, in large part due to their high percentage of female Tech workers. According to the report, female Tech workers now make up 41 percent of the Tech workforce in D.C., a significant departure from the nationwide percentage of just 26 percent of Tech jobs held by women.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Kansas City, MO<\/strong> <strong>|\u00a0Index Score: 83.25<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>A surprising contender for the best cities for women in Tech, Kansas City\u00a0has maintained its number 2 spot for the past three years in large part due to women working in Tech making more than their male counterparts. However, it fails to nab the top spot since the number of roles held by women in Tech continues to decline.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Baltimore, MD |\u00a0Index Score: 81.53<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Following close behind is Baltimore where there has been a 4.2 percent increase in the number of Tech jobs held by women since 2016. The city&#8217;s tech workforce has also grown remarkably in the past five years with more than 12,400 computer and mathematical jobs added since 2012.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Indianapolis, IN |\u00a0Index Score: 73.65<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>You might not immediately think of Indianapolis when you think of Tech talent hotbeds, but that is exactly what it is for female Tech talent. Tech startups are thriving in this affordable city and women benefit from a gender pay gap that actually\u00a0<em>favors<\/em>\u00a0them over men.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>New Orleans, LA |\u00a0Index Score: 73.40<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>New Orleans is one of the cities with the best environment for women in Tech overall. Pay is relatively equal regardless of gender, and the\u00a0number of Tech jobs grew by 32 percent from 2012 to 2015, which is the largest four-year change in Tech employment growth in Smart Asset&#8217;s analysis.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fremont, CA |\u00a0Index Score: 71.43<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>While it&#8217;s not the first California city you&#8217;d expect to find on this list, being home to the Tesla factory definitely helps. Women hold around 27 percent of the Tech jobs in the city and earn around 16 percent less than their male counterparts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>New York, NY |\u00a0Index Score: 70.69<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>While NYC is a notable Tech talent and startup hotbed, it ranks lower due to the 10 percent gender pay gap for women working in Tech and the 15 percent growth in the number of Tech jobs over the past four years,\u00a0substantially less than higher-ranking cities like Baltimore, New Orleans, and Fremont.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Detroit, MI |\u00a0Index Score: 70.20<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Another surprising contender for the best cities for women in Tech, Detroit is one of just three cities listed with a reverse gender pay gap. Here, women working in Tech make 5 percent more than their male counterparts. Female Tech workers also\u00a0make up 42 percent of the Tech workforce in Detroit, just barely beating out top-ranked D.C. for the\u00a0highest percentage of female Tech workers in the country. The city gets docked for lower income ranges on average compared to other cities listed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Denver, CO |\u00a0Index Score: 70.20<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Tied with Detroit, Denver comes in at the number 8 spot\u00a0on\u00a0this list as well. Pay equity is an issue, with women making 6 percent less on average than men for the same job, but overall women tend to make salaries that afford them a higher quality of living here.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Philadelphia, PA |\u00a0Index Score: 69.95<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Last but not least, Philadelphia rounds out this list of the best cities for women in Tech. This is largely due to the increased ratio of female-to-male earnings which currently sits at 92 percent, up from 89.5 in 2016. Philadelphia also ranks high for its proportion of female Tech professionals in the workforce.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_column_text]Diversification in Tech talent is crucial to your company&#8217;s continued success and U.S. efforts to remain a leader in Tech innovation.
