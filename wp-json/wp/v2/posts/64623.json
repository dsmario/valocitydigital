In fact, individuals with the most in-demand cybersecurity skills are netting some of the highest salaries out of all Tech professionals.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a look at what&#8217;s driving the growing demand for cybersecurity talent in the U.S. and the most in-demand cybersecurity roles your business should prioritize hiring for now.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>Demand for Cybersecurity Talent Continues to Rise<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Awareness and education are the driving factors behind the growing demand for cybersecurity talent. As execs and business owners learn more about the complicated and ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, they better understand the need and ROI that hiring cybersecurity talent offers.\u00a0Most notably, the frequent headlines depicting hacks of companies and organizations from Yahoo to the U.S. Government and even smaller targets like Dallas&#8217; emergency alert systems have shown companies of all sizes that hackers have varied motives and no target is too big or too small.<\/p>\n<p>Dallas recently saw all 156 of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2017\/04\/dallas-siren-hack-wasnt-novel-just-really-loud\/\">emergency sirens hacked<\/a> and activated on April 7. The alarms were set off at 11:40 p.m. and it took officials nearly two hours before they were able to turn them off, but not before the entire Dallas community spiraled into a panic (Over 4,000 calls to 911 were made). This is just one of many infrastructure hacks that have been\u00a0on the rise in the U.S., which has led companies to stop asking why hackers might prey on them and instead prep for the possibility of such an attack by hiring the cybersecurity experts they need.<\/p>\n<p>Everything from electric road signs to suburban dams to emergency text and TV alert systems have been targeted. Cybersecurity experts are sounding alarm bells trying to raise awareness to these types of attacks and the need for organizations to prioritize hiring cybersecurity experts and implementing more effective security measures.<\/p>\n<p>But companies can&#8217;t successfully protect themselves against sophisticated cyber attacks if they can&#8217;t find the cybersecurity specialists they need to hire. Cybersecurity talent is so hard to find even the FBI, an organization known for having extremely strict hiring requirements for applicants, is considering <a href=\"http:\/\/bigstory.ap.org\/article\/ffb1c40ad0084dda8a3bb190b929a2a2\/can-hack-not-shoot-fbi-may-ease-entry-cyber-agents\">easing some of those requirements<\/a> to attract more cybersecurity talent. James Comey, the Director of the FBI, has suggested altering some of those requirements like those related to marijuana use, physical strength, and aim with a firearm, in an effort to attract the shrinking pool of cybersecurity talent in the U.S. away from private sector careers.<\/p>\n<p>Because demand is so high, skilled cybersecurity professionals are enjoying some of the highest salaries of any Tech professionals. For those interested in Tech or currently working in a related field,\u00a0there has never been a better time for a career switch.\u00a0Businesses across all industries now realize that to net and retain the cybersecurity experts they need to secure their data and online services, they must offer higher salaries and more flexible policies regarding work from home and remote work options.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>The Most In-Demand Cybersecurity Jobs<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]To help protect your business from the growing threat of cyber attacks, here&#8217;s a look at the most in-demand cybersecurity jobs for 2017 and the average salary ranges these positions net to help you make more informed hiring decisions and retain the talent you hire:[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/hire-cybersecurity-engineers\/\">Cybersecurity Engineers<\/a>:<\/strong> Professionals in this role are instrumental in\u00a0managing all aspects of a company&#8217;s online security, which is why every business needs them.
