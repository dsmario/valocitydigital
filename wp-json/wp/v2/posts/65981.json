At your company CDOs\u00a0play a significant role in re-evaluating the hiring process by ensuring HR considers candidates from a variety of sources with varying backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s normal if revitalizing your internal culture induces stress, yet it&#8217;s crucial to remember that a CDO&#8217;s long-term goal is to create diversity initiatives that take from both your core business needs along with the well-being and inclusiveness of each employee.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h3>The Chief Diversity Officer Trend in Tech<\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Silicon Valley companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook have had CDOs since 2016.

A recent survey by McKinsey &amp; Company found that diverse companies not only outperformed competitors but experienced\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/organization\/our-insights\/delivering-through-diversity\">15 percent more profitability<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2017, Uber went through a public relations and social crisis when former Uber Engineer, released statements regarding an inappropriate work environment for female employees during her time with the company.
