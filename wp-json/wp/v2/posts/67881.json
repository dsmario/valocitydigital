The Agent of Excellence is someone who exemplifies what it means to be an Agent of Change, lives and breathes MAP, drives innovation, and helps shape our Mondo culture. Here\u2019s a look at what we learned by sitting down with this month\u2019s Agents of Excellence, Janie Marcus.<\/span>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since joining Mondo a little over two months ago, Janie has already fully adopted our core values and dove headfirst into the day-to-day operations, becoming an instrumental member of our MondoX team.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out the following Q&amp;A to learn more about Janie, her experience working at Mondo, and why she loves all aspects of her role as a Recruitment Consultant for MondoX.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Janie\u2019s favorite thing about working at Mondo:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI would have to say my favorite thing would be the support I receive; being a part of the MondoX team and actually getting trained with the team in Chicago. The level of support I&#8217;ve felt since day one is something I&#8217;ve never experienced before. It&#8217;s been almost eleven years since I graduated, and I&#8217;ve worked various jobs, and none of them have shown me the level of respect and excitement that I&#8217;ve received since joining.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s this excitement that has really helped with the ups and downs that come with this role. Having a super supportive team to back me up, celebrate the wins, and be there for the losses has been unlike anything I&#8217;ve experienced before.\u201d<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;3&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row row_height_percent=&#8221;35&#8243; back_image=&#8221;67235&#8243; parallax=&#8221;yes&#8221; overlay_color=&#8221;color-jevc&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;25&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;4&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243;][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; position_vertical=&#8221;middle&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1560875735436{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-gyho&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;In all my years of staffing, I have NEVER witnessed somebody \u2018get it\u2019 so quickly. Janie (AKA J, Janay, Janei) has an unreal combination of empathy, drive, and street smarts that can&#8217;t be taught. She is MAP AF, EVERY single day, and brings an energy and enthusiasm to MondoX that is truly magnetic. She is a perfect example of Mondo 3.0, working as a true consultant to clients and candidates. And to think, she&#8217;s just getting started.&#8221; &#8211; David Ingleheart, Lead Recruitment Consultant for MondoX<\/span>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; position_vertical=&#8221;middle&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1560875798757{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<b>Based on her experience, here\u2019s the advice she would give to new recruiters:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think they have to come into a role like this with an open mind and be willing to take as much time as possible to really listen and learn from your peers. You have to check your ego at the door because it won&#8217;t matter how much experience you&#8217;ve had at another company. Instead, I think you have to look at this as a fresh start and a clean slate to build up an entirely new skill set. Everyone here at Mondo has something to teach so there are constantly opportunities to learn, and I would recommend new employees take advantage of these resources.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The three adjectives Janie used to describe #MondoLA:<\/b>[\/vc_column_text][uncode_list]<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Motivated<\/li>\n<li>Hungry<\/li>\n<li>Commited<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1560875791387{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;3&#8243;][vc_single_image media=&#8221;67884&#8243; media_width_percent=&#8221;100&#8243; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1560875749129{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<b>Janie\u2019s thoughts on how Mondo compares to previous employers:\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI mean, it goes back to the support element and the celebrations. Every win here is heavily celebrated nationwide, and they really make everyday struggles and battles worth it; you end up feeling loved and supported all the time at Mondo. I actually had never worked in staffing before coming to Mondo, and my background is in marketing and social media. At those companies, they were always looking for the quickest way to make a dollar without caring about who they had to trample on to get there.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their work cultures just weren&#8217;t aligned with my own morals and values. Mondo is, of course, driven by revenue as well, but constantly working to motivate their employees so they know they are supported and have the resources to fall back on when needed. This has really motivated me to keep working harder and feel like I\u2019m working towards something bigger than yourself.\u201d<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1560875791387{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_single_image media=&#8221;67888&#8243; media_width_percent=&#8221;100&#8243; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; position_vertical=&#8221;middle&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1560875798757{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]<b>What keeps Janie motivated?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy team! My team has really kept me motivated. Monika is an amazing leader, and she has motivated me and inspired me every single day, as well as the rest of the MondoX team. Though my team is based in Chicago and starts a few hours ahead of me, I&#8217;m always excited to see what they&#8217;re working on and the progress they&#8217;ve made while sharing the progress I&#8217;m making.

Being named the Agent of Excellence means that everything I&#8217;ve worked on, everything my team has taught me, every piece of encouragement is paying off and turning me into a better professional. This gives me hope that although I left a ten-year career to start anew, that I&#8217;ve made the right choice. This is the path that is in line with what I want to do but also what I&#8217;m meant to do. This title was validation that I&#8217;m really in the early stages of what will become a lifelong career for myself.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Janie has clearly found success by fully immersing herself into Mondo&#8217;s people-centric culture and soaking in the knowledge of her MondoX team and the recruiters who sit in her LA office. Janie proves that you can thrive at Mondo and succeed if you&#8217;re willing to come in with an open mind and an eagerness to learn.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congrats again to Janie on being named this month&#8217;s Agent of Excellence!
