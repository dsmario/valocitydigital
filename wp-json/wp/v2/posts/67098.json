From ensuring that products and services are sold and delivered to finding new ways to increase revenue, being an IT leader is challenging. However, becoming an effective IT leader can be an even harder task, especially when you consider the results from a study conducted by the University of Tennessee which revealed <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pdfs.semanticscholar.org\/0c31\/b2b87e56504cf8747eb39908335209ca423a.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">67 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the IT professionals surveyed were introverted. Your leaders need to communicate well with their IT teams. Yet if your talent in general, is introverted, communication can be difficult. Now is the time to discover the importance of finding new strategies to open the dialogue and become an effective IT leader.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;1&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<b>The Importance of Effective Leadership<\/b>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Only <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomleaders.com\/blog\/2018\/10\/9\/interesting-statistics-about-effective-leadership\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of businesses have implemented leadership development opportunities, while <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hrpa.ca\/Documents\/Public\/Thought-Leadership\/HRPA-Millennials-Report-20161122.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">63 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of millennial professionals unveiled they feel the companies they work for have a lack of leadership development, according to a report by the Brandon Hall Research Group.
