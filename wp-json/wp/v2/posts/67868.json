How do they end up onboarding so many talented engineers? Google&#8217;s global staffing lead and senior recruiter Lisa Stern Haynes insist that they&#8217;re able to employ engineers due to their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/01\/10\/google-uses-this-shocking-strategy-to-hire-the-best-employees.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hiring committee<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Take a note from the tech giant and put together a team of engineers who can serve as your hiring committee. The committee works by providing unanimous approval of any candidates before they are offered the role. Haynes claims implementing this hiring committee has helped them eliminate hiring bias and avoid the long-lasting effects of onboarding a bad hire.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><strong>Sell the truth.<\/strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as a candidate needs to sell themselves during the interview process, your hiring team must also sell your company and your open role, especially given today\u2019s candidate-driven market.

The key to attracting and retaining engineering talent is by generating excitement about your open role; exaggeration will only lead to disappointment, high-turnover, and negative reviews from confused candidates that will hurt your company&#8217;s online brand and reputation. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Embody an engineering culture. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Addison&#8217;s 2019 Workplace Report revealing that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/addisongroup.com\/insights\/insight\/2019-workplace-survey\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">64 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of engineers said the most important thing to them was the work they do, it&#8217;s fair to say that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/employers\/blog\/attract-tech-talent\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cultivating a culture<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where your engineering talent feels valued and respected would help attract these in-demand professionals.
