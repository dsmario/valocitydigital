The Agent of Excellence is someone who exemplifies what it means to be an Agent of Change, lives and breathes MAP, drives innovation, and helps shape our Mondo culture. Here\u2019s a look at what we learned by sitting down with this month\u2019s Agent of Excellence, Alexandra Doyle.<\/span>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex\u2019s journey at Mondo started at a sales desk where she was cold calling to build her book of business. Management quickly identified Alex as a high-impact player; eventually becoming a manager at Mondo\u2019s Philly&#8217;s office before being tasked with rebuilding the Boston office\u2019s business line. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cTaking Boston by storm in late 2017 \u2014 no office grew in Mondo like Boston \u2014 it\u2019s no surprise the driving force behind that office, and the culture that has helped breed their success is Alex,\u201d &#8211; Matt Leighton, Mondo\u2019s VP of Talent.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out the following Q&amp;A to learn more about Alex, her experience, and what she values most about working at Mondo.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1534174652384{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_single_image media=&#8221;67006&#8243; caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; media_width_percent=&#8221;100&#8243; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; position_vertical=&#8221;middle&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1534174644903{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_column_text]<b>What is your favorite thing about working at Mondo?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would say it\u2019s the opportunity. Not only the opportunity in terms of career growth but the opportunity to grow individually. That\u2019s something I look back on over my four years; not only seeing the opportunities that led me to all I was able to accomplish here at Mondo but also in my personal life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>What has Mondo been able to offer you that previous positions didn\u2019t?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAccountability! I\u2019m someone who\u2019s naturally self-motivated, whatever I do I give 100 percent. However, when you\u2019re someone who\u2019s motivated that way, a lot of the times you\u2019ll be in a position where people don\u2019t hold you accountable because they don\u2019t need to worry about you. After talking to Stephanie Wernick for the first time, I knew she was someone who was going to hold me accountable. Though I had other offers, I went with Mondo because I felt that I\u2019d be held accountable and being held accountable by others pushes you to do better.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>Using three adjectives, how would you describe the culture at your office?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDedicated, resilient, and non-complacent!\u201d<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1534174652384{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_column_text]<b>How has working at Mondo impacted your personal life?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWorking at Mondo has allowed me to take pride in myself and acknowledge all of the hard work I\u2019ve put in. Whenever you\u2019re succeeding or doing the right thing, it will never go unnoticed, and that was a huge boost to my confidence. It started blending into my relationships outside of work and helped me learn how to be direct. Coming from the hospitality world, Mondo has taught me that relationships are a two-way street. It\u2019s so important in any relations, whether an HM or your significant other there needs to be mutual respect, which is something I\u2019ve learned to be direct and demand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>After four years here at Mondo, what keeps you motivated every day at Mondo?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis has changed for me throughout the years, but I think it goes back to opportunity. I have the opportunity to control what I can achieve, and that\u2019s very motivating. The fact there\u2019s always a challenge, something with a deal, a client, or one of your reports, but I\u2019m able to face that and own whatever the outcomes are.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; position_vertical=&#8221;middle&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1534174644903{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_single_image media=&#8221;67007&#8243; caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; media_width_percent=&#8221;100&#8243; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1534174621966{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_column_text]<b>What does being an Agent of Excellence mean to you?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u201cFirst, honestly, I was shocked that I was named the Agent of Excellence. It shows that I&#8217;ve taken on some very challenging roles over the last few months. I think being the Agent of Excellence means you&#8217;re always questioning the right decision, but also remembering that your managers and team believe in you. It was a special moment for me and a reminder that I need to believe in myself and reflect on what I&#8217;ve done so far and what I can do in my new role. An agent of Excellence knows they must believe in themselves first before anyone else can.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>A Few Shout-Outs from Alex\u2019s #MondoBoston Fam<\/b>:<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][uncode_list]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Her level of commitment is unmatched!&#8221;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Alex\u2019s dedication to her team and this company is beyond admirable.&#8221;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Follow Alexandra\u2019s lead, and success will follow.&#8221;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After talking with Alex, it&#8217;s clear she&#8217;s found success by staying true to Mondo&#8217;s MAP and accountability has been her greatest tool throughout her four years with us. As Alex put it, working at Mondo has helped elevate her confidence and helped her continue to push past the limits. Before ending our talk, Alex finished our conversation by leaving me with this:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Working at Mondo is a long-term challenge and commitment, and it takes years of hard work and grit, but when you get to look back, I must say, everyone involved exceeded my expectations.&#8221; &#8211; Alex Doyle<\/p>\n<p>Congrats to Alex on being named the Agent of Excellence!
