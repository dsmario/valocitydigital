To help drive awareness for this year&#8217;s Computer Security Day,\u00a0here are our top cybersecurity training tips for your employees to ensure the devices\u00a0and data at your company remain hacker-proof. After all, your employees are your first defense against\u00a0cyberattacks\u00a0and can be unintentionally responsible for a future cybersecurity breach if not properly trained.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>Top Cybersecurity Training Tips For Your Employees:<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Develop a Security Culture<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]It&#8217;s crucial to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.techrepublic.com\/article\/how-to-make-your-employees-care-about-cybersecurity-10-tips\/\">develop a security culture\u00a0<\/a>to remain protected against evolving\u00a0cybersecurity\u00a0threats. If your employees don&#8217;t know how to spot a potential phishing attempt or understand the need for enhanced password protection, then it&#8217;s more likely your business will become the latest victim of costly\u00a0cyberattacks\u00a0that have now become routine headlines.<\/p>\n<p>This is the most crucial element to protecting your most valuable resource: your company data. Initiate a revamp that prioritizes cybersecurity to\u00a0your company culture by having your IT team create department-specific cybersecurity\u00a0trainings\u00a0for the rest of the company. Training should cover cybersecurity tips like how to spot a potential cybersecurity attack and map out clear directions on how to report\u00a0suspected security threats. It should also cover the reasoning behind why certain devices are unauthorized to handle company information. If employees understand the\u00a0<em>why<\/em>, they&#8217;ll be more apt to follow these tips and become a more successful defense against future hackers.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally,\u00a0maintain this security culture by providing quarterly or annual\u00a0trainings\u00a0with updated information on what steps employees should be taking to secure their devices, accounts, and personal information. Consider\u00a0sending a monthly newsletter with information on recent high-profile hacks and newly developed threats to keep cybersecurity top of mind for your employees.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Restrict Access Where Possible &amp; Create Password Policy<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Two of the top cybersecurity training tips to\u00a0implement at\u00a0your business are to create a password policy for all employees to follow and restrict access as much as possible to sensitive data, devices, or software. When it comes to creating a password policy, avoid putting all responsibility for password changes on your IT department. Yes, cybersecurity experts should be the only ones\u00a0updating and\u00a0knowing passwords to your network and software technologies and these should be the only employees set up as Admins to\u00a0minimize access to sensitive information and the risk of a hack.<\/p>\n<p>However, all employees should adhere to an established password policy as a part of your employee guidelines. An effective company-wide password policy should require employees across every department to update passwords to email and any other accounts where sensitive information is shared or store on a monthly or quarterly basis. Additionally, for higher-ranking employees, this should also apply to their social media accounts given the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mondo.com\/blog-social-cyberattacks\/\">recent emergence of social cyberattacks<\/a>,\u00a0and the difficulty users often have\u00a0with identifying them.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Stay Current on Emerging Cybersecurity Threats<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Investing in your\u00a0cybersecurity\u00a0and IT teams\u00a0is\u00a0crucial to staying ahead of ever-evolving\u00a0cybersecurity\u00a0threats.
