Now, imagine that the locations of these experts no longer mattered. Tech talent relocation is viewed as an expense of the past. Borders, whether it be city, state, or country lines, no longer impact your ability to net the best Tech talent available. This future is possible, and it&#8217;s coming sooner than you think.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>The Growth of Remote Tech Talent<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]While remote or telecommuting employees is not a new trend, it is one that\u00a0is rapidly picking up steam with recent technological advancements and a new emphasis on work-life balance from millennials entering the workforce. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flexjobs.com\/blog\/post\/work-flexibility-milestones-infographic\/\">68 percent of U.S. workers<\/a> reported they expect to work remotely in the future and remote work among non-self-employed professionals has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flexjobs.com\/blog\/post\/work-flexibility-milestones-infographic\/\">grown 103 percent<\/a> since 2005. We&#8217;ve also seen an increase in demand for full-time, remote IT\/Tech employees from our client base in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>However,\u00a0eating the cost of relocating the Tech specialists\u00a0you can&#8217;t find locally is still a significant component of the hiring process for various companies. According to Hired&#8217;s 2017 <a href=\"https:\/\/hired.com\/state-of-salaries-2017\">report on hiring trends<\/a>, Austin, a major Tech hub, had over 60 percent of their job offers going to Tech experts living outside the state. Similarly, 30 percent of Tech job offers from San Francisco-based companies were going to candidates outside the city. While relocating the candidates you need is common today, we predict the rates of remote Tech workers will rise dramatically with the refinement and implementation of AR-driven office spaces and tools.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>The End of Tech Talent Relocation<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]As remote work has grown in popularity, telecommunication technologies, solutions, and tools have improved.\u00a0Cloud-based solutions like AWS and Azure allow Tech specialists to access the data they need without being on-location. Enhanced video-communication\u00a0tools like screensharing\u00a0through Google, Skype, Apple&#8217;s FaceTime, and more have made telecommuting and remote work more reliable and thus a reality for a wide array of professions, especially in Tech, where work is often siloed and completed more efficiently individually.<\/p>\n<p>However, these tools are just the beginning of the possibilities for telecommuters or remote employees. Augmented reality (AR), or mixed reality (MR), depending on which definition you prefer is the key to making Tech talent relocation obsolete. To replace the need for on-site Tech experts, there can&#8217;t be any disruption or negative effect on collaboration, communication, and technical capabilities between co-workers or departments. This is exactly what AR can provide.<\/p>\n<p>Telecommuting is cited as one of the <a href=\"http:\/\/reports.weforum.org\/future-of-jobs-2016\/employment-trends\/\">biggest drivers of transformation<\/a> in the workplace, and the development of enhanced AR capabilities would disrupt and entirely transform the Tech workplace as we know it. AR presents the opportunity to create entirely virtual office spaces no matter your location. Plugging into AR could turn an empty room into a meeting with several Tech employees discussing and showcasing their work, code, or solutions on virtual whiteboards or screens.\u00a0With access to all of the virtual tools, technologies, and solutions they&#8217;ll need at home or in their preferred workspace, IT and Tech professionals would no longer be needed on-site without sacrificing collaboration or communication functions.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>The Benefits of Ending Tech Talent Relocation<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]While some companies are holding onto the idea that innovation is only created when people physically come together in the workplace, studies actually prove the opposite. In-person meetings have been shown to stifle creativity since they result in what&#8217;s called &#8220;anchoring,&#8221; and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/alvin-chia\/how-remote-work-will-be-t_b_9863892.html\">independent thinking<\/a> has been shown to drive innovation rather than collaboration. Many <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.cloudpeeps.com\/top-10-companies-winning-at-remote-work-culture\/\">Tech-driven startups<\/a>, like Automattic, the creators of WordPress, have paved the way for the\u00a0end of Tech talent relocation by proving how effective remote work and telecommuting are at driving innovation and creativity.<\/p>\n<p>And the benefits of ending Tech talent relocation don&#8217;t stop there.

The location of candidates will no longer impact your ability to hire them. Rather than paying to relocate a Tech expert to your area, save on those costs and instead hire them as a remote employee, expanding the reach of your talent nationally or even globally to otherwise inaccessible options.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Expansion of the Tech talent pool.<\/strong>\u00a0Prioritizing remote employees means the talent pool of Tech specialists would actually expand by incentivizing millennials who value work-life balance to enter the Tech sector and allowing older employees to continue working longer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cost savings.<\/strong>\u00a0Not only will your company save on relocation expenses, but you&#8217;ll also be able to drastically cut overhead costs, especially for new IT\/Tech startups, by hiring remote teams rather on-site teams. Through the use of AR technology, you&#8217;ll require fewer devices, hardware, and real estate for your business to thrive and grow. According to our placements, remote employees often receive lower rates than on-site workers, which means more savings and increased ROI. In fact, if professionals with telecommuter-friendly jobs did so just half the time, a typical business would save at least <a href=\"http:\/\/globalworkplaceanalytics.com\/telecommuting-statistics\">$11,000 per person per year<\/a>\u00a0and telecommuters would save between $2,000 and $7,000 a year.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Increased employee retention.<\/strong>\u00a0Remember Automattic, the startup behind WordPress, mentioned above? They boasted <a href=\"http:\/\/davemart.in\/2015\/04\/22\/inside-automattics-remote-hiring-process\/\">100 percent retention<\/a> in both their design and growth departments credited to their remote work policy.

However, the end of Tech talent relocation and the transition to an entirely remote workforce would increase gender diversity by eliminating the need to live in a certain zip code, removing the problem of childcare coverage by allowing WFH, and\u00a0removing the obstacle of male-driven work environments that have been known to isolate female employees.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Looking Ahead<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]It will be interesting to follow the trends relating to relocation and remote\u00a0work for Tech professions as AR technology continues to be refined and enhanced for business purposes.
