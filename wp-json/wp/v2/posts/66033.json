A young Caucasian, transwoman will need different strategies to meet her specific needs versus those an older African American, cis-woman would need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developing an intersectionality lens will assist you in better understanding the intricate systems of inequality that subconsciously operate in your company\u2019s workplace. Utilizing intersectionality in tech will help you craft tools to combat divisiveness amongst your team while helping you create a framework to develop changes that will then produce an inclusive work culture for all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Tech business must understand that intersectionality is\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2018\/03\/intersectionality-is-not-the-enemy-of-free-speech\/555014\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not simply a buzzword<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0you can afford to ignore but a social tool needed to establish a work environment where all employees feel respected, included, and have the opportunity to grow not only as an employee but as an individual.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>Benefits of Intersectionality in Tech<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year\u2019s SXSW event held\u00a0the panel, Tech-no-color: Advancing Women of Color in Tech, discussed the inclusion and diversity issues Tech companies face.

This adoption will help you realize the complex layers of each of your employees, helping you gain a better understanding of how to assist them. Your Tech-based employees won\u2019t need to look for other opportunities if you are building a culture that appreciates them as\u00a0the individuals they are and provides them with the specific tools necessary for personal and professional growth.
