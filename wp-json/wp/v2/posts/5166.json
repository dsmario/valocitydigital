In fact, a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/resources\/pdfs\/comm\/achievers\/hbr_achievers_report_sep13.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business Review<\/a> surveying more than 550 executives on \u201cThe Impact of Employee <span class=\"il\">Engagement<\/span> on Performance,\u201d showed 71% of executives citing a high level of employee <span class=\"il\">engagement<\/span> as a \u201cfactor most likely to bring success.\u201d This number is particularly interesting when viewed in comparison to other factors that scored lower, such as efficient productivity (68%), continuous quality improvement (59%), ability to innovate (59%), and strong sales and marketing capabilities (58%).<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The thing is\u2006\u2014 most employees aren\u2019t actually <span class=\"il\">engaged<\/span>. A 2014 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gallup.com\/poll\/181289\/majority-employees-not-engaged-despite-gains-2014.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Gallup poll<\/a>defining <span class=\"il\">engagement<\/span> as \u201cthose who are involved in, enthusiastic about and committed to their work and workplace,\u201d reported just 31.5% of US employees to be <span class=\"il\">engaged<\/span> at work, compared with 51% not <span class=\"il\">engaged<\/span>, and 17.5% actively disengaged. These numbers are trending up from previous years, but still point to a glaring lack of interest in our day to day professional activities. Perhaps more indicative of the current environment is the fact that Gallup found Millennials to be the least <span class=\"il\">engaged<\/span> demographic, with just 28.9% claiming <span class=\"il\">engagement<\/span> at their current workplace.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<\/p>\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">So, how do you create employee <span class=\"il\">engagement<\/span>, especially around our newest generation of workers?<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There\u2019s the obvious use of financial incentives, either by increasing someone\u2019s salary or offering performance-based compensation, yet that alone won\u2019t lead to the levels of <span class=\"il\">engagement<\/span> that really make a difference. In order to create real <span class=\"il\">engagement<\/span> you need to both provide your employees with the tools they need to succeed, as well as the encouragement to actually do it.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let\u2019s take a look at a few specific approaches for engaging your workforce:<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Highlight Individual Accomplishments<\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]In <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/resources\/pdfs\/comm\/achievers\/hbr_achievers_report_sep13.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business Review\u2019s<\/a> report, 72% \u201cof respondents rank[ed] recognition for high performers as having a significant impact on employee<span class=\"il\">engagement<\/span>.\u201d In fact, singling out individual accomplishments ranked higher than staff pay linked to corporate goal achievement (54%), business goals communicated company-wide and understood), and several others.[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Weekly MVP: Individual managers pick a performance-based MVP every week, identified by a traveling trophy to publicly identify him or her.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Monthly MVP: One member of the company is selected for exceptional performance and receives an adequate reward. Prizes can be anything from a monetary bonus, to an extra vacation day, to the ability to work from a different office location one week. May it a something worth fighting for!<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Financial Incentives: No matter how <span class=\"il\">engaged<\/span> your employees are, they still show up every day in order to receive a paycheck. There\u2019s no denying the power of monetary encouragement, and when incentivized properly this tactic can have a huge affect on company-wide performance. A little competition goes a long way when there\u2019s money on the line.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Reward the Whole Team<\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]The power of teamwork is well documented, and while competition can certainly motivate individuals to up their performance levels, concentrating on the group rather than the individual shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All-Inclusive Incentives: Set goals that can only be met as a team, meaning each and every member must work hard in order for anyone to get a reward. By making the prize contingent on the whole team\u2019s performance you eliminate the possibility for someone to take a back seat to a busy workload.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Make it Visible: Track team performance somewhere that everyone can see it. Doing so allows teammates to encourage one another, not compete, \u00a0since every individual must be successful in order for anyone to benefit.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Be Candid About Your Goals<\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the biggest reasons cited for workers not feeling <span class=\"il\">engaged<\/span> is a lack of alignment with, or understanding of, the company\u2019s goals. As an employer there\u2019s no way to ensure that your full roster of employees feel passionately about your mission, but there are ways have them know exactly what it is they\u2019re working towards.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Make sure managers are candid about the big picture. Menial tasks and everyday busy work can feel grueling, but it\u2019s worth it when you know your hard work is going towards a larger company goal.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">State company objectives on the wall, or email them out as periodic reminders of your mission. Make sure they know why they\u2019re there!<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Let Everyone Be Heard<\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]It\u2019s challenging to engage employees who feel like just another cog in the wheel of the corporate structure. A 2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.re-imaginework.com\/content\/40\/Big-data-helps-bust-the-top-three-myths-of-employee-engagement-and-leadership\" target=\"_blank\">IBM<\/a> report greatly speaks to the power of listening to your employees, finding that \u201corganizations that surveyed their employees saw <span class=\"il\">engagement<\/span> levels on average 20 percentage points higher than those that did not survey employees.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Have annual town hall meetings with the CEO to put a face to the C-Suite and allow those at every level to ask questions and air concerns.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Allow employees to air grievances to management anonymously in order to be heard without jeopardizing their professional relationships.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Make sure managers regularly meet with their teams in a casual setting to check in on how everything is going. People are a lot more willing to speak up in a laid-back, open forum rather than a one-on-one status report.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]Simply asking employees whether or not they\u2019re happy, or what the company can do to enrich their work experience can go a long way.
