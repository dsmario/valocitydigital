Around\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/b2b-assets.glassdoor.com\/benefits-employees-want-most-2017.pdf\">57 percent<\/a>\u00a0of candidates reported benefits and perks are among their top considerations before accepting a job, according to Glassdoor&#8217;s 2017 employee benefits guide. Tech employers should take extra time when crafting benefit and perks\u00a0plans because the IT industry tied\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/resources.glassdoor.com\/the-benefits-employee-want-most.html?channel=internal&amp;utm_medium=b2b&amp;utm_source=email-nurture&amp;utm_campaign=benefits-employees-want-most-b2b&amp;mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTVRZMVpEVmxZakEyWVdSbCIsInQiOiJPcWgwRVk4VXhnQk5vcUNnMCtpb2ZcLzY2V0VvY3IrdGJLZHR4UmNMN2NSYllcL2lQdGNiaHBmUVJKSTREWkszcWJYR2ZQMGhONWNNQ1F4WEV5SUxaOFwvV2FNTGc0YndJS0R2VWhxXC9DTExNZlZDYk1ZclRwdjd2dWNBaFB2Z2Z0ZGVKN3VxdHYwbVZvbTV6YXl4aGpTNjVRPT0ifQ%3D%3D\">for the top spot<\/a>\u00a0among industries with the highest-rated benefits. Which means whatever you choose not to offer, your competitors will. The tech-based talent war is real, but the key to providing\u00a0in-demand talent with the benefits that will entice and retain them is investing in what matters most to them.<\/p>\n<p>It should be no surprise that better health, dental, and vision insurance\u00a0was rated the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.frac.tl\/employee-benefits-study\/\">most important benefit<\/a>\u00a0by Fractl&#8217;s 2017 Employee Benefits Study. It was also ranked as the top benefit based on correlation of overall satisfaction with benefit packages in\u00a0that same\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/b2b-assets.glassdoor.com\/benefits-employees-want-most-2017.pdf\">2017 Glassdoor<\/a>\u00a0employee benefits survey. Proving this core element of your benefits plan matters more than specific benefits or perks like paid maternity\/paternity leave or vacation time. Getting it right and offering the best health, dental, and vision plans possible for your employees will also do more to improve employee satisfaction, which\u00a0often results\u00a0in increased retention and improved productivity, than catered meals or fun office decor will.<\/p>\n<p>While providing high quality, extensive health insurance\u00a0to employees costs much more than fun or &#8220;trendy&#8221; perks might, it&#8217;s often a major factor in a candidate&#8217;s decision of whether or not to accept a job offer.\u00a0Coupled with the unpredictable future of U.S. health insurance coverage, an investment in expanding the health insurance benefits of your employees now is one that will provide the most ROI when it comes to attracting and retaining the high-end, in-demand talent you&#8217;re after.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Trust &gt; Money &amp; Perks<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Surprisingly, money takes a back seat when it comes\u00a0to the most valuable employee benefits today. This is especially true for millennials; 90 percent of\u00a0those surveyed said they would prefer better benefits over higher pay according to a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/b2b-assets.glassdoor.com\/benefits-employees-want-most-2017.pdf\">2015 Glassdoor survey<\/a>. The same holds true for raises with nearly 80 percent of workers, regardless of age, saying they would prefer new or additional benefits to a pay increase, according to that same Glassdoor guide. What could be more a valuable\u00a0benefit to employees than money? Trust.<\/p>\n<p>After health insurance,\u00a0Fractl\u00a0found that the next most valuable employee benefits after health insurance were flexible hours, more vacation time, work-from-home options, and an unlimited vacation policy. These benefits are valued so highly candidates reported they would\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2017\/02\/the-most-desirable-employee-benefits\">take a lower-paying job<\/a>\u00a0with these benefits over a higher-paying one that doesn&#8217;t. So how can you integrate them into your benefits plan? To provide more flexible hours, remote or WFH options, and an unlimited vacation policy\u00a0you must trust\u00a0your employees to\u00a0manage these benefits responsibly. If there is no trust between the employer and the employees, then you likely won&#8217;t see these types of benefits at your business. However, there are ways to develop that trust and provide employees with these benefits as they earn them.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re uncomfortable implementing these types of benefits company-wide or automatically offering them to new hires consider implementing a tenure-based policy where employees can earn them after a set amount of time with the business. Mondo followed this structure with our new\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mondo.com\/blog-case-study-work-life-balance-prioritization\/\">Flexible Work Arrangement<\/a>\u00a0which allows internal employees with a year of tenure the opportunity to WFH and set flexible hours directly\u00a0through their manager. It&#8217;s a simple\u00a0strategy that helps establish a mutual level of respect and trust in the workplace\u00a0and provides employees with the benefits they really want once they&#8217;ve shown they\u00a0can manage them responsibly.<\/p>\n<p>The best part? All of these trust-based benefits are relatively low-cost\u00a0for the employer, and, in the case of the unlimited PTO policy, may even save you money. (If you do go with an unlimited PTO policy, make sure you don&#8217;t fall into the common problem of having employees\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mondo.com\/pto-policy-problem-2017\/\">avoid taking vacation days<\/a>.)[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Know Your Audience<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Last but not least, when evaluating your employee benefits make sure you know what your audience finds valuable. While 401K matching might not be the most valuable\u00a0benefit\u00a0to millennials right now, paying off their student debts is. Over 44 million Americans have student loan debt yet only\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/08\/17\/student-loan-debt-why-employers-may-want-to-help-pay-off-college-loans.html\">three percent of firms<\/a>\u00a0surveyed by AonHewitt currently offer student loan repayment assistance. Offering student loan assistance is an innovative and effective strategy used by companies like yours looking to entice the most in-demand college grads and stand-out from competitors who lack this valuable employee benefit.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, the most valuable employee benefits to parents differ from the rest of your employees. According to a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.flexjobs.com\/blog\/post\/survey-parents-rank-work-flexibility-ahead-salary\/\">recent survey<\/a>\u00a0by FlexJobs, parents value flexible hours and work-life balance more than salary and health insurance in a potential job.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes down to it, the key to providing your employees with the benefits they value most is to understand what matters to them. While offering high-quality health insurance should be the core investment\u00a0of your employee benefits package, trusting your employees with additional benefits like WFH flexibility and unlimited PTO and sending out annual surveys about their satisfaction with your benefits are effective strategies\u00a0in helping you maintain a benefits package that is attractive to both potential and current employees.<\/p>\n<p>If you are unable to find or attract the in-demand Tech or Digital Marketing talent you need,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/mondo.com\/contact\/\">contact Mondo<\/a>\u00a0today.
