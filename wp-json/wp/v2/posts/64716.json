By definition, a CGO is tasked with ensuring and managing a company&#8217;s growth; through metrics like revenue, social ROIs, and employee engagement. A qualified CGO will be able to collaborate, measure, and provide c-level support with growth initiatives, all in the name of expansion and results.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>CMO vs. CGO<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingweek.com\/chief-growth-officer-coca-cola\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coca-Cola<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/lyft-adds-two-new-execs-to-its-roster-amid-ipo-woes\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lyft<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and even Kimberly-Clark have opted for a CGO over their previous CMO position. Why? According to experts, due to emerging technologies and the demands of digital transformations, it&#8217;s becoming clear that the CMO needs help from a fellow c-suite focused on driving revenue and business growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For continued success in a marketplace now saturated with online marketing campaigns, Coke had to reevaluate their reliance on marketing and the aspects of their corporate structure resulting in limited growth. Implementing a Chief Growth Officer within their global organization was a way to cut through the red tape between departments and direct all growth drivers to one skilled, innovative professional with the sole focus of driving overall growth. Despite companies like Coke scrapping their CMO role altogether to make room for their CGO position, this might not be a one-size-fits-all solution.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CGO role is tasked with creating <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignlive.co.uk\/article\/not-just-glorified-cmo-charting-rise-chief-growth-officer\/1401123\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new pathways<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to growth by optimizing limited resources, maximizing the impact of investment, and monitoring future trends. Which is why a company like yours will benefit most from onboarding a CGO, not as a replacement, but, as an enhancement or source of support for your CMO. <\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h2><b>When to Hire a Chief Growth Officer: 3 Questions to Ask<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before making any drastic changes to your current team of marketing professionals, here are three questions you&#8217;ll need to ask yourself when deciding if the right move for your business is to hire a CGO:<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-certificate&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Can your company size support a CGO? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite big brands like Coke and Lyft onboarding CGOs, research shows that the smaller the company is, the bigger the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingprofs.com\/chirp\/2017\/31732\/the-growth-of-the-chief-growth-officer-is-a-cgo-right-for-your-company-infographic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">opportunities of growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be. This means small-to-mid-sized companies have the most to gain by hiring a CGO, who will ensure they reach the next level of expansion and growth. You now have to remember having a lean workforce also signifies there is a lot of room for your business to grow, meaning you more than likely have a plethora of overlooked opportunities CGOs are skilled in identifying, which will ultimately help boost your audience reach and positively impact your bottom line.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>For those considering replacing a CMO with a CGO, is it the role or the talent that needs replacing? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a CMO isn&#8217;t driving growth to the expected level, it&#8217;s important to evaluate if the results are due to a lack of skill and expertise of the talent or if there are elements of the corporate structure that make it impossible for the CMO to generate the levels of growth expected of them. The replacement of CMOs with CGOs can be tied to the fact that a Chief Growth Officer has less red tape and more cross-departmental capabilities that lead to more effective growth-generating strategies and results. If structural hierarchy, company politics, or other internal hurdles are hindering the CMO&#8217;s efforts, hiring a CGO might be necessary. If it&#8217;s the talent that is the problem, look to hire a new CMO that defines themselves by their ability to innovate and drive growth rather than their advertising abilities.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><b>What are your immediate goals or needs? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What goals do you envision for your company in the next two, five, and ten years?
