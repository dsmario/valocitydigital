Once you find the perfect hire, you may realize, retaining your Tech professionals is just as tricky as attracting them in the first place. Replacing employees with specialized skill sets or those in a senior Tech-based role will cost your company money, resources, and manpower, which is why several forward-thinking businesses are seeking practical methods to retain Tech talent.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Impact Of Increased Turnover Rates in Tech\u00a0<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to\u00a0Spicework&#8217;s\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/community.spiceworks.com\/research\/tech-career-outlook\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018 IT Career Outlook<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one-third of IT professionals, nationwide, plan on finding a new job this year. More than 60 percent of Tech professionals across the current working generations are unhappy with their current salaries, according to that same report. During the ongoing industry-wide talent gap, it&#8217;s crucial that your new Tech hires feel valued by your business. If your Tech talent feels under compensated, it won\u2019t take long for them\u00a0to to\u00a0find (or be poached) for a new career opportunity with a competitor who is willing to pay them what they\u2019re worth considering how in demand Tech talent is today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition,\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cio.com\/article\/3269324\/hiring-and-staffing\/6-reasons-why-it-workers-will-quit-in-2018.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">79 percent of IT specialists<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0reported they would accept new positions if they felt the job would expand their skill sets and also offer a better work-life balance. Clearly, failing to invest in developing your Tech talent\u2019s skill sets and providing improved work-life balance initiatives will result in higher turnover rates, which can lead to unmotivated workers, negatively impacted work culture, and delays with project deadlines. Given the fact that speed to market often determines the success of Tech-based products, solutions, and services, retaining the Tech experts on your team should be viewed as the key to your company\u2019s future success and prioritized as such.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>How To Retain Tech Talent<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent report from the Frost &amp; Sullivan Center for Cyber Safety and Education unveiled that up to\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/iamcybersafe.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/N-America-GISWS-Report.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.8 million IT jobs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0will be vacant by 2020. To help reduce turnover rates among your Tech workforce, which in turn can help recruitment efforts amidst the current industry-wide talent gap, here are 3 practical strategies to help you better retain Tech talent.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner column_width_percent=&#8221;90&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;color-210407&#8243;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Rethink Your Benefits.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing a quality benefits plan is a practical strategy that can likely increase your retention rates and productivity\u00a0levels,\u00a0while decreasing your turnover rates. Mondo&#8217;s CEO, Tim Johnson, highlighted that many Tech companies make the mistake of\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil\/2018\/04\/17\/three-most-in-demand-employee-benefits-of-2018\/#319409625510\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">offering trendy perks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0the industry has become known for, like free laundry, ping pong tables, and comped lunches as a part of their core benefits. Instead, Johnson suggests that Tech businesses ask their employees directly which benefits they find the most valuable. Doing so will allow you to provide Tech talent with the benefits that matter most to them, which can lead to improved work satisfaction levels, reduced turnover rates, improved work culture, and increased productivity while also helping you better attract fellow Tech experts for available roles.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Do The Research &amp; Offer Competitive Salaries.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to offering employees better benefits, providing them with a competitive salary will not only help retain Tech talent but will attract other highly skilled specialists to your company. CIO revealed that more than\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cio.com\/article\/3269324\/hiring-and-staffing\/6-reasons-why-it-workers-will-quit-in-2018.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0of IT professionals are looking for new employment opportunities due to\u00a0undercompensation. Offering your talent competitive salaries will show your Tech professionals that they are seen as assets rather than expenses. Paying your employees a competitive salary will give you an advantage over the businesses who don&#8217;t see this as a necessity.

It\u2019s important to remember that employees\u2019 work experiences will differ based on race, gender, and sexuality, which is why integrating intersectionality can be beneficial in helping create a more inclusive work culture. Integrating intersectionality helps create a toxic-free environment that recognizes employees as individuals and take into account what is needed for both their professional and personal growth.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now is the time for your Tech business to develop and implement practical strategies to increase your talent retention efficiently.
