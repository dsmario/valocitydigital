Though, with every great new tech innovation\u00a0comes\u00a0the possibility of a cyber threat for all involved. Cryptojacking, a new practice that finds hackers hijacking computers to mine and generate digital coins AKA cryptocurrencies, is the latest cyber threat that has arisen since the Bitcoin craze started.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>What Exactly is Cryptojacking?<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Cryptojacking refers to the secret use of someone\u2019s computer, smartphone or internet of things (IoT) device and using it as a vessel to mine cryptocurrency. The entire process can occur within a few minutes, helping the hackers go unnoticed.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wondering why you should care? Well, earlier this week automotive powerhouse Tesla revealed hackers had\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/02\/21\/hackers-hijack-teslas-cloud-system-to-mine-cryptocurrency-redlock.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">infiltrated its cloud system<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0to mine cryptocurrency.

Because in this situation, hackers are precisely like parasites. They aren\u2019t looking to damage their host computer; however, the results from several hijacked sites have already provided a few examples of just how destructive cryptojacking can be. Some mining malware has even\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/information-technology\/2017\/12\/currency-mining-android-malware-is-so-aggressive-it-can-physically-harm-phones\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">caused physical damage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0to infected devices, like smartphones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Kaspersky Lab, an antivirus provider, conducted a study focusing on a mining tool located in third-party Android apps. Kaspersky researchers discovered that after two days of mining via malware-carrying apps, the device\u2019s battery began to expand deforming the physical structure of the phone.<\/p>\n<p>Though this may seem like a hack purely for financial gains, there is evidence that some cryptojackers may have ulterior motives that would lead to more damage than just a smartphone battery, possibly targeting a business&#8217;s consumer data and other sensitive information.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Segura, a lead malware intelligence analyst at network defense firm, Malwarebyte, reports that he\u2019s seen this technique before where hackers used cryptojacking as a decoy while simultaneously deploying a more dangerous\u00a0cyberattack\u00a0that damages a systems infrastructure and privacy.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<b>Strategies You Can Implement<\/b>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Although much of the research conducted so far has only shown mobile devices negatively affected by mining, businesses must remember that we are still in the beginning stages.

Since hackers must mine through your computer, a tell-tale sign is\u00a0strain\u00a0on your hardware and processing speeds. Once employees are aware of this, they can look out for the signs and help catch the cryptojacking before it\u2019s too late.<\/li>\n<li><b>Ad-blockers.\u00a0<\/b>Now that cryptojacking is becoming just as popular as cryptocurrency itself, many web browsers are aiming to aid users in the fight against it. Depending on your choice of internet browser it may come preinstalled, like Opera Mini, which comes with a built-in Adblock, or more popular choices, like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox which have Adblock extensions, since many hackers will place cryptojacking malware in the form of pop-up ads.<\/li>\n<li><b>Hire Cybersecurity Talent.\u00a0<\/b>Though awareness and ad-blockers can be great strategies to prepare and protect from a mining hack, hiring specialized cybersecurity talent with the experience and knowledge to combat these kinds of cyber attacks is the most secure solution when it comes to preparing your company for a possible cryptojacking hack.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]Cybersecurity roles like the Security Engineer, Security Administrator, or Cryptographer function as your company\u2019s frontline defense.
