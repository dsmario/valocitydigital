Sure likability is important, but Tech experts,\u00a0specifically, must have the smarts to get the job done well.\u00a0But by valuing intellect over everything we miss the true mark of a successful candidate: emotional intelligence.<\/p>\n<p>Emotional intelligence, also referred to as EI or EQ (emotional quotient), is a buzzword everyone likes to throw around, including\u00a0quasi-counselors on shows like The Bachelor. But it&#8217;s often\u00a0an overused yet undervalued word when it comes to hiring.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Let&#8217;s Get Emotional(ly Intelligent)<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Emotional intelligence first picked up steam in the 90s with Daniel Goleman&#8217;s bestseller, &#8220;Emotional Intelligence.&#8221; The book outlined the five core constructs of EI, which are:[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-heart-outline&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Self-awareness<\/li>\n<li>Self-regulation<\/li>\n<li>Social Skills<\/li>\n<li>Empathy<\/li>\n<li>Motivation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]Considering the findings in the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www3.weforum.org\/docs\/WEF_Future_of_Jobs.pdf\">World Economic Forum&#8217;s Future of Jobs Report<\/a>\u00a0that emotional intelligence will be one of the top 10 job skills by 2020, it&#8217;s critical hiring managers and C-level roles understand why hiring for this skill is critical to a successful business. As more of these hiring experts learn about EI, the skill set has\u00a0started popping up on more job postings as one of the\u00a0primary job requirements.<\/p>\n<p>Studies throughout the past several years have noted EI as a core\u00a0skill set of 90 percent of superstar performers in various industries, not high IQ like previously believed. (Which was only present in\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/11-signs-you-lack-emotional-intelligence-2017-1\">70 percent of top performers<\/a>.) So what do those with EQ, as some call it, do better? A lot actually.<\/p>\n<p>Employees with high levels of emotional intelligence handle pressure and stress better by being aware of any changes in their emotions\u00a0as they happen and implementing healthy coping mechanisms to relieve any stress or negative emotions to remain in control. They know when to take a step back rather than waiting until they reach their breaking point. Their empathetic nature allows them to collaborate effectively with and react accordingly to others from a diverse range of cultures and background, which reduces the occurrence\u00a0of internal bickering or office politics.<\/p>\n<p>These individuals also tend to have excellent listening skills and pick up on body language allowing them additional insight into conversations and the ability to\u00a0easily adjust\u00a0their behavior or work as recommended. They also know when to say no in terms of commitment and their ego for the betterment of the business.<\/p>\n<p>Most of us get the general idea of emotional intelligence.

(Trust us. You&#8217;ll be surprised at what you missed when you weren&#8217;t\u00a0focused on noticing genuine EQ.)[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list]<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Transition your interview technique to behavioral event interviewing.<\/strong>\u00a0Avoid commonly asked interview questions that candidates prep scripted answers for beforehand. Instead, make the interview informal, conversational, and warm at the start. It creates a more comfortable\u00a0and friendly atmosphere that encourages honesty. Then delve into specific behavior-based questions. One positive and one negative experience-based question. After the initial basics, ask for more details. Looking into both these experiences in-depth will give you insight into their self-awareness levels, ability to empathize, self-regulation capabilities, and what their motivation was. Ask for various perspectives of the experiences from those involved to get an idea of their emotional awareness and maturity.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.interviewedge.com\/articles\/Conducting-the-Behavioral-Event-Interview-BEI.htm\">Behavioral event interviewing<\/a>\u00a0comes with practice and gets a bit awkward at times, but will correctly identify whether\u00a0the\u00a0individuals have the EI skills you&#8217;re looking for in the right candidate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use your local resources.\u00a0<\/strong>It&#8217;s likely many of the employees in your business have high emotional intelligence, which was probably one of the reasons they were hired whether it was ever actually evaluated or put into words. Use these resources! Ask them for referrals to friends, colleagues, and connections that would fit well with your business that reflect the same emotional intelligence as the\u00a0employee. They will feel encouraged that the impact of their EI\u00a0didn&#8217;t go unnoticed and will appreciate the opportunity to help identify\u00a0the individuals, teams, and departments they&#8217;ll work best with.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t rely on personality tests.\u00a0<\/strong>This may seem like the\u00a0easy answer, but results are often far from accurate with these types of tests. They evaluate exactly what they say they do, personality, which is not the same as emotional intelligence. A face-to-face interview is the best way to identify EQ or the lack thereof.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]Emotional intelligence is a driver of innovation,\u00a0problem-solving, healthy business cultures, and effective collaboration.
