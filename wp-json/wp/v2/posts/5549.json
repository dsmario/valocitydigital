She wished she had studied engineering and is making this product to compensate. She grew up in Honolulu and likes surfing, swimming, snorkeling, diving; pretty much anything that involves oceanic immersion. She used to front a rock band and nothing can get between her and Chop\u2019t.<\/em>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>How did you get the idea for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gethopscotch.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Hopscotch<\/a> and how did the company get started?<\/p>\n<p><strong>JOCELYN:\u00a0<\/strong>Sam and I were both members of the NYC startup community and wanted to start our\u00a0own company. Although we hacked around on many different side projects, we kept\u00a0returning to this realization that there weren\u2019t that many girls starting companies or\u00a0working as engineers. We kept asking ourselves why this occurred and as we spoke to\u00a0our engineer friends, many of whom were guys, some patterns emerged. A lot of these\u00a0guys started programming when they were 10 or 11; they fell in love with playing video\u00a0games and started making their own. Sam and I got interested in technology much later\u00a0on in life, but we both wished we had had an experience like these guys when we were\u00a0growing up. It seemed like that early contact with video games laid the groundwork for\u00a0their success, so Sam and I envisioned a product that could appeal to a broader\u00a0demographic.<\/p>\n<p><b>MONDO:\u00a0<\/b>Does having grown up in Hawaii have an influence on your company? What about\u00a0how you, as a business person, operate?<\/p>\n<p><strong>JOCELYN:\u00a0<\/strong>Hawaii is a very strong part of my identity. People have told me that it\u2019s reflected in my\u00a0personality, but it\u2019s hard to parse out correlation and causation. I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m\u00a0pretty low-key and mellow, especially for someone from New York. I try not to take\u00a0things too seriously and I try to be humble; a large part of Hawaiian culture centers\u00a0around your humility and Aloha spirit, which translates into kindness and love for\u00a0people.<\/p>\n<p>I think Hawaii also impacted how I think about education. Growing up, I was particularly\u00a0interested in Hawaiian culture and indigenous modes of education. In the Western\u00a0tradition, you go to school, sit at a desk, and listen to a teacher, but much of what you\u00a0\u201clearn\u201d might not be retained. Indigenous education is very hands-on and project-based.<\/p>\n<p>This concept is reflected by educational philosophers like Piaget and Dewey, and these\u00a0ideas inform the ethos of what we\u2019re trying to do with Hopscotch. In our model, kids\u00a0acquire knowledge by actually building things\u2014\u201dlearning by really doing\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>Your website says you want to change the world. How does Hopscotch\u2019s mission\u00a0help you to accomplish that?<\/p>\n<p><strong>JOCELYN:\u00a0<\/strong>I\u2019ve been idealistic my whole life and I\u2019ve always wanted to do things that help people\u00a0and change the world. I think this mindset is very common among girls, which is one of\u00a0the reasons women don\u2019t go into computer programming; very often, computer science\u00a0is not framed as a means of changing the world when, in fact, it can be hugely powerful.<\/p>\n<p>At Hopscotch, we\u2019re building an accessible way for non-engineers to use their phones\u00a0and other touchscreen devices to program and experience the empowerment that\u00a0programming gives you. I think that tapping into this power will have very broad\u00a0implications for the future.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>Hopscotch is all about \u201cbuilding something.\u201d Do you think this taps into the same\u00a0instinct kids have to play with Legos or build a fort?<\/p>\n<p><strong>JOCELYN:\u00a0<\/strong>Definitely.\u00a0Recently the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Hopscotch\" target=\"_blank\">@Hopscotch<\/a> twitter account tweeted Edwin Land\u2019s quotation: \u201cAn\u00a0essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>MONDO:\u00a0<\/b>When did you take a\u00a0chance and fail, but ultimately learn from the experience?<\/p>\n<p><strong>JOCELYN:\u00a0<\/strong>I feel like that happens every week at Hopscotch. We\u2019re trying new stuff and failing all\u00a0the time. A big part of the creative process is having a lot of different ideas and,\u00a0invariably, not all of those ideas are going to be the right ones. More than half of them\u00a0will fail and a few of them will be quite successful.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>In your bio you mention that you wish you had studied engineering. Why is that?\u00a0What\u2019s your educational background?<\/p>\n<p><strong>JOCELYN:\u00a0<\/strong>There are so many things that I like about engineering. I like the idea that you\u2019re\u00a0inventing, making, and trying to solve a particular problem with a practical solution\u00a0meant to be used by other people. That aspect appeals very much to me and my\u00a0personality.<\/p>\n<p>But when I was in school, engineering just seemed so dry and irrelevant. I didn\u2019t have a\u00a0clear sense of what engineering even was, but it didn\u2019t seem intellectually engaging and\u00a0wasn\u2019t marketed particularly well. Knowing what I know now, I wish I had studied\u00a0engineering because I think I would\u2019ve loved it.<\/p>\n<p>As for my own education, I started out as an Environmental Studies major because I\u00a0was deeply idealistic and wanted to work on international development and indigenous\u00a0peoples issues; later, I turned towards Geography. I also studied Music and Education\u00a0and became increasingly more involved in the Education department over the course of\u00a0my college career.<\/p>\n<p><b>MONDO:\u00a0<\/b>Do you think it\u2019s important for those in less analytic, more humanities-driven\u00a0fields to learn to code via an app like Hopscotch?<\/p>\n<p><strong>JOCELYN:\u00a0<\/strong>Just as every engineer benefits from exposure to the humanities, I think every person\u00a0who studies the humanities should have exposure to STEM. The phobia of math and\u00a0science that is perpetuated and accepted in the United States is quite a shame. High\u00a0functioning adults can excuse limited math skills by saying, \u201cOh, I\u2019m just not good with\u00a0numbers,\u201d and will still be considered smart. People would not receive the same\u00a0response if they said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m just not good at reading.\u201d In the United States, illiteracy is\u00a0not considered okay, and yet it\u2019s acceptable to be innumerate or not understand\u00a0empirical processes. Some exposure to rational, problem-solving decision making\u00a0would actually benefit everyone a great deal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>Do you think coding skills should be included in all school curriculums? Is\u00a0coding the new \u201cart class\u201d in kindergarten?<\/p>\n<p><strong>JOCELYN:\u00a0<\/strong>I do think that coding skills should be included in school curriculums because, if nothing\u00a0else, it can demystify how the computers that surround our daily lives work. Yet, as a\u00a0former teacher, I can understand how the idea of a new requirement sounds terrifying,\u00a0especially if you are under resourced. Part of the problem is that there aren\u2019t enough\u00a0trained teachers out there, but Hopscotch can help. We just released a curriculum\u00a0designed for teachers without a shred of computer science background who want to\u00a0teach computer science in the classroom. It\u2019s free; just visit our site and download it.<\/p>\n<p>Teaching \u201ccoding\u201d doesn\u2019t always have to happen on the computer, either. You can find\u00a0coding curriculums that require a pen and a piece of paper and never touch a computer.\u00a0You can find board games that teach \u201ccoding\u201d; it\u2019s really just about writing algorithms\u00a0and algorithms are all around us. When I was growing up, we had Home Economics\u00a0class where you learned how to cook. Writing a recipe, to some extent, is in many ways\u00a0just an algorithm: a set of instructions that need to be very clear and repeatable so that\u00a0another person can understand and execute them. In programming, the only difference\u00a0is that the other person is a computer with a more specific vocabulary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>What do you think is at the root of the lack of women in tech-fields? Can\u00a0Hopscotch help to close that gap?<\/p>\n<p><strong>JOCELYN:\u00a0<\/strong>I think there are a couple of different roots. There\u2019s the pipeline problem. There\u2019s the\u00a0fact that historically, not as many girls have been interested in programming and\u00a0engineering during the critical middle school years. A lot of times, identities get formed\u00a0at those grades that will sustain an interest through high school when others become\u00a0distracted.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also the problem of attrition when women enter tech. We\u2019re well aware of the\u00a0existence of sexism and we\u2019ve got to reduce it. The whole point of Hopscotch is to close\u00a0this gap.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>Where do you see Hopscotch 5 years from now?<\/p>\n<p><strong>JOCELYN:\u00a0<\/strong>In five years, Hopscotch will be much more ubiquitous. It won\u2019t just be for kids; it\u2019s going\u00a0to be on phones as a useful utility that anyone can use to create and share amateur\u00a0programs. Fifty years from now? Who knows what the world will even look like.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>As a female entrepreneur in the tech industry do you have any advice for other\u00a0women looking to start their own tech businesses?<\/p>\n<p><b>JOCELYN:\u00a0<\/b>I have a female co-founder and it is a real joy; we get along so well and I really\u00a0appreciate that. But I think it\u2019s harder to have an all-female founding team.\u00a0My general advice to founders is make friends with other founders. They\u2019re the most\u00a0useful people to know. Investors are constantly evaluating you, so remember to\u00a0establish friendships and make a good impression. If you don\u2019t have to be a venture-backed startup (i.e., your product is not consumer-facing or it\u2019s a consumer product that\u00a0can monetize quickly), try not to take venture money. People may pigeonhole you as a\u00a0\u201clifestyle\u201d business, but don\u2019t be deterred.<\/p>\n<p><em>To learn more about Hopscotch and download the app, visit their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gethopscotch.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a>.<\/em>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243;
