Should students be able to choose between foreign and coding languages to fulfill their language requirement? Or, more broadly, does developing coding language proficiency contribute more to U.S. students&#8217;, and our country&#8217;s, future ability to innovate and become a global leader than proficiency in a foreign language? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer? It&#8217;s complicated.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>The State of Computer Science Education in the U.S.<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To understand this issue and why the answer is more complicated than it seems, you need to understand the current state of computer science education in the U.S. This debate has largely stemmed (pun intended) from our country&#8217;s renewed interest and investment in the STEM curriculum style, which puts an emphasis on what are considered the most important and underdeveloped skills in U.S. students: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To compete in a world that continues to get smaller, we need our students to graduate from our educational systems and institutions well-equipped to tackle the problems of the 21st century and drive an increasingly tech-driven economy forward without falling behind our top competitors. So, how well are we preparing them? Only <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/code.org\/action\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">32 states<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, along with the District of Columbia, allow computer science courses to fulfill a math or science high school graduation requirement. This means they&#8217;ll have to use electives to take computer science courses; if their school even provides adequate computer science options.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prioritizing computer science classes and elevating them to a graduation requirement in the form of a foreign language credit means schools will be forced to provide adequate computer science courses that allow students to complete the required number of credits. It also means the government will need to invest directly in developing these options nationwide.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Where We&#8217;re At Now<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]You don&#8217;t have to look far to learn about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.monster.com\/career-advice\/article\/tech-talent-gap-survey-0816\">escalating tech talent crisis<\/a> in the U.S. or that it&#8217;s continuing to get worse despite more awareness being brought to the problem. There simply isn&#8217;t enough tech talent to go around. Many critics believe it&#8217;s due to the lack of computer science prioritization in the U.S. education system. So far, pitching coding languages as a suitable replacement to foreign language credits to resolve the problem isn&#8217;t going over well, but it has had limited success.<\/p>\n<p>Florida, Texas, Washington, Kentucky, and Virginia have all introduced this type of education legislation to their representatives, while states like Michigan, Washington, New Mexico, and Georgia have played with the idea. Texas is the only state that has passed legislation that allows computer science courses to be substituted with required foreign language credits once a student has attempted and performed poorly in a foreign language class.<\/p>\n<p>A Florida bill was introduced in 2016 by state Sen. Jeremy Ring that would give students a choice between foreign or coding language classes for college admissions requirements, but eventually died after passing 35-5 in the Senate initially. Although it failed, Ring defended it by saying, &#8220;I think the opportunity to give people a choice [is important].\u00a0I think if you&#8217;re just going to give two years [of language] in high school, you might as well do computer coding, because I think it&#8217;ll take them further than two years of foreign language will,&#8221; according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/news\/stem-solutions\/articles\/2016-10-13\/spanish-french-python-some-say-computer-coding-is-a-foreign-language\">U.S. News<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>1 to 49.
