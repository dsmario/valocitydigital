While many digital designers thought the idea to be an exciting opportunity, few actually spent time working on the technology or improving it. For the most part, VR held a small, niche audience in the computer gaming industry, but even this niche lost interest as video game systems moved inside of households and the equipment required to produce any sort of VR game would cost more and require more space than what most gamers could afford\u00a0and offer. Recently, VR has made a strong comeback as now technology has reached a point where it is affordable to create and sell the necessary hardware to gamers on almost any budget. Virtual reality has taken a major turn in its development, and it requires truly skilled professionals to make VR not just a virtual reality, but a true reality. It isn&#8217;t just people picking up video cameras and trying to record every angle. It is so much more than that. Only the very best VR pros can develop beautiful content, used by not only game developers but advertisers, real estate agents and professional sports teams.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>The Education of a VR Professional<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Virtual reality is still a rather new area of work, despite having existed for a few decades. Due to this, most colleges do not offer specialized VR only degrees. Instead, VR might be part of the educational course or a specialty inside of the major, but it can vary from school to school. Most of the professionals who work in the field hold degrees (often multiple degrees) in <strong>digital modeling<\/strong>, <strong>CAD programming<\/strong>, <strong>human-computer interaction<\/strong>, <strong>meta language,<\/strong> <strong>animation, creative methodologies<\/strong>, development and implementation and multiple other program platforms. Most top graduates move forward to not only work in the field, but develop their own programming to produce the needed content[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>Veterans\u00a0Day Parade in New York<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Veterans are an extremely important part of the foundation and continual safeguarding of the United States. <strong>Veterans Day<\/strong> is one day in which the country turns and solutes previous and current members of the military. The largest display of this appreciation takes place in New York City with the Veterans Day Parade. However, all veterans are not able to make it to the parade. For one reason or another, the ability to experience this grand parade in the nation&#8217;s largest city just does not present itself and watching it on television makes the parade feel distant. Google wanted to change this. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.org\/impactchallenge\/disabilities\/veterans.html\" target=\"_blank\">Google\u00a0recently filmed the Veteran&#8217;s Day Parade in order to convert into VR<\/a>. With this conversions, veterans unable to make the parade can done specially designed headgear and find themselves instantly transported to the parade. Here, they can watch the parade from the side or march in the parade. While in the VR, they can look about them, see the faces of the soldiers around them and know what it is like to take part in the parade.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>So Much More<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]VR has so many options for business, organizations and institutions it is essential to start considering this product. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2015\/09\/09\/us\/nfl-virtual-reality-training\/\">NFL\u00a0football programs use VR to train players<\/a> visually in real time over simply watching tape, companies are showing what it is like to sit in a vehicle or visit a new location.
