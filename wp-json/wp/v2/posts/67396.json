The Agent of Excellence is someone who exemplifies what it means to be an Agent of Change, lives and breathes MAP, drives innovation, and helps shape our Mondo culture. Here\u2019s a look at what we learned by sitting down with this month\u2019s Agent of Excellence, Mary Schadler.<\/span>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mary\u2019s journey at Mondo started almost three years ago, as an entry-level Technical Recruiter. She quickly realized her work ethic and efficiency went hand in hand with Mondo\u2019s. By holding herself, and her team accountable, Mary has been able to have continued success.\u00a0<\/span>Check out the following Q&amp;A to learn more about Mary, her experience, and what she values most about working at Mondo.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>How Mondo compares to Mary\u2019s previous employers<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was at another staffing firm for around two years. I was successful there, I consistently closed deals but the urgency just wasn\u2019t there. If I could take everything I learned at Mondo and apply it to my old position, I\u2019d have been able to close so many more deals. The efficiency around recruiting that Mondo has just wasn\u2019t there at previous jobs.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What keeps Mary motivated every day?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHonestly, I\u2019d have to say my team.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think we have built such a great culture. Even though I am-money motivated and love finding success through closing my own deals, nothing makes me happier than seeing my team members improve and grow. The way our culture is set up, we all love each other, and they definitely are the ones who help me get out of bed when I\u2019m not in a good headspace.\u201d<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading]<\/p>\n<h3>Mary\u2019s thoughts on the culture in Chicago<\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][uncode_list]<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accountable\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resilient <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;3&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row row_height_percent=&#8221;35&#8243; back_image=&#8221;67235&#8243; parallax=&#8221;yes&#8221; overlay_color=&#8221;color-jevc&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;25&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;4&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243;][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; position_vertical=&#8221;middle&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1560875735436{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-gyho&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMary has been with Chicago since August 2016 and has absolutely crushed every goal put in front of her.
