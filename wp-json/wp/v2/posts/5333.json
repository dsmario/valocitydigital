What might surprise you, is that one of the biggest trends in web design and development isn\u2019t based in technology at all, but rather in the crucial\u2014but sometimes forgotten\u2014human element.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies can no longer ignore the importance of Customer Experience (CX) when building digital experiences. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.signalinc.com\/inside-cx-the-elements-of-customer-experience\/?utm_source=Signal&amp;utm_campaign=3021847c8c-CX_Differentiator&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_8dcfcd8777-3021847c8c-276750045\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CX<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is defined as \u201cthe sum total of what your customer wants, does, sees, thinks, feels and likes,\u201d and in an increasingly digital world, we must extend its best-practices to digital design and development. Now UX\/UI Designers are stepping in to close the gap between user and creator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User Experience (UX) Designers tackle how the product feels, whereas User Interface (UI) Designers work on the actual layout of its elements. Essentially it\u2019s the UX designer\u2019s job to make sure the UI designer knows exactly how to lay out the wireframe, or arrange the buttons on a machine, based on the interaction they want the user to have with that given product. Since the two roles are so intrinsically linked, most CX-concerned positions combine UX\/UI into one role.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here are five key reasons to bring a UX\/UI Designer on board:[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;1&#8243;][vc_custom_heading]<strong>To Organize Your Website<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All good designers knows how important a solid <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Information_architecture\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information Architecture<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to the success of a website. Imagine going into a grocery store with no signs, no aisle markers, and no clear exit. There\u2019s a good chance you would get frustrated and leave rather than searching for the specific product you came in for. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is exactly what companies want to avoid, especially those with e-commerce sites that need a clear path to the checkout page. It\u2019s the UX\/UI Designer\u2019s job to map out a website, organize the content, and make sure users can find exactly what they\u2019re looking for.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>To Know What the User Wants<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All websites should be created a specific goal in mind. E-commerce sites want users to make a purchase, editorial sites want users to read and share their content, and so on. The great thing about UX\/UI is its ability to tap into user\u2019s brain in a measurable way that can be communicated directly to the designer, developer, and client. It&#8217;s all about engagement and knowing the customer&#8217;s journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google\u2019s HEART Framework is a great tool for CX Metrics that measures Happiness, \u00a0Engagement, Adoption, Retention, and Task Success. UX\/UI Designers typically solicit test-users to try out a wireframe or website, then report back on how the experience was received. Real people, with real experiences that can be both quantitatively and qualitatively measured.

Users are real people, with a myriad of needs that need to be kept in mind. Don\u2019t forget:[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Responsive Design:<\/strong> Ensures a seamless user experience\u00a0across desktop, mobile, and tablet devices of all sizes. \u201cMobile users are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.experiencedynamics.com\/blog\/2015\/03\/30-ux-statistics-you-should-not-ignore-infographic\">five times more likely<\/a>\u00a0to abandon the task if the site isn\u2019t optimized for mobile,\u201d so optimizing across all devices is almost a requirement.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Internet Connection Speeds:<\/strong> Although slow dial-up modems are largely a thing of the past, developers must still consider load times for when the user is away from their (hopefully) speedy home network. With\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/econsultancy.com\/blog\/10936-site-speed-case-studies-tips-and-tools-for-improving-your-conversion-rate\">40% of online shoppers<\/a>\u00a0abandoning a page that takes more than three seconds to load, it\u2019s important to keep things snappy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Browser Consideration:<\/strong> Not everyone uses Chrome on a brand-new MacBook Pro. It\u2019s\u00a0essentially\u00a0to consider your\u00a0audience,\u00a0and make sure the site will work on all browsers, as well as older device models.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>To Identify the User<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s be honest, not every site is for everyone. It\u2019s unlikely that someone living\u00a0in small-town USA will visit a website that lists upcoming concerts in NYC, just as the music-lover in Manhattan probably isn\u2019t hitting up\u00a0restaurant listings in Ohio. And different audiences mean different needs and concerns when it comes to design and development.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many UX\/UI Designers craft \u201cpersonas\u201d in order to better understand the target user. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2014\/08\/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A persona is<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cdepicted as a specific person but is not a real individual; rather, it is synthesized from observations of many people\u2026[as] a way to model, summarize and communicate research about people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By honing in on the different types of users that a specific site might experience, UX\/UI Designers are able to identify their needs, desires, and behaviors that will factor into the ultimate site design and features. For example the NYC concert-attendee is probably on the go a lot, so he\u2019ll want an easy to view mobile platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get to know who it is you\u2019re creating for! Key elements to identify include:<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age, gender, location<\/li>\n<li>Daily behavioral habits<\/li>\n<li>Interests, likes, dislikes<\/li>\n<li>Accessibility needs<\/li>\n<li>Familiarity with your product\/brand<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>To Advocate For The User<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes many minds to create a website, and naturally everyone involved comes to the table with a different goal in mind. The designer wants to make the site as beautiful as possible. The developer wants to be sure all functionality elements perform properly. The project manager wants to keep the client happy, and make sure their expectations are met. No matter what, UX\/UI Designers are there to advocate for the user!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider this common scenario: Your design team is hellbent on adding in an awesome, but unnecessary flourish to the homepage. The project manager thinks the client will love it and the developer is excited to build it using new animation techniques. The only problem? It makes the user sit idly by for 30 seconds until they can access the navigation menu.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good UX\/UI Designer is there to step in and remind the rest of the team that users get impatient, no matter how cool the effect. Abandoning the site in favor of a faster-moving competitor is never an OK outcome, and ultimately everyone on the team knows that.
