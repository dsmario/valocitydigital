The Agent of Excellence is someone who exemplifies what it means to be an Agent of Change, lives and breathes MAP, drives innovation, and helps shape our Mondo culture. Here\u2019s a look at what we learned by sitting down with this month\u2019s Agent of Excellence, Heather Schwarz.<\/span>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out the following Q&amp;A to learn more about Heather, what she has learned so far, and what she loves most about working at Mondo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>After the time you\u2019ve spent here at Mondo, what keeps you motivated every day at Mondo?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u201cLA is an exciting city, a big city, and every time we talk to the Exec team they always tell us how LA has the biggest opportunity for staffing. What has kept me motivated is the excitement in finding new leads and new accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Even when I\u2019ve failed one day with one account, I don\u2019t let that get me down because I know the next day I\u2019ll have an opportunity with other accounts, and honestly that\u2019s my biggest motivation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Based on your experience as an AD, what advice would you give to new employees just joining the Sales team at Mondo?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe first 90 days are the most stressful, but if you grind and give it all you have, you will start to see the results. I know it\u2019s hard to see beyond what\u2019s currently in front of you. This job will get easier with each day, you will find so much success, and have fun while doing it. So my biggest piece of advice would be to stick through the hard times because it will only make you 1,000 times better at this job.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;3&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row row_height_percent=&#8221;35&#8243; back_image=&#8221;67235&#8243; parallax=&#8221;yes&#8221; overlay_color=&#8221;color-jevc&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;25&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;4&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243;][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; position_vertical=&#8221;middle&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1560875735436{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-gyho&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThroughout 2019 there has been nothing but adversity in LA.
