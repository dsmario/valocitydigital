As the largest staffing agency specializing in high-end, niche IT, Tech and Digital Marketing talent, one of the most common issues we see with our clients begins with\u00a0unclear job descriptions.\u00a0\u00a0You have to speak to your target audience effectively through the job description to attract the most qualified talent available. If critical details, key company information, or\u00a0important day-to-day information is missing from the job description, in-demand talent will simply move on rather than apply and inquire further. Look into key strategies on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mondo.com\/blog-drive-traffic-to-tech-job-postings\/\">how to increase interest<\/a>\u00a0in your Tech or Digital Marketing job postings to help speed up your hiring process and net in-demand applicants.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Utilize Your Internal Network<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]We&#8217;ve said it before, and we&#8217;ll\u00a0say it again, your internal employees are a great resource when it comes to finding your next in-demand Tech or Digital Marketing hire. Before turning the search to external sources, consider implementing a company-wide referral\u00a0program for your employees to incentivize them to refer the qualified candidates in their networks. This can be an especially effective strategy for the Tech or Digital Marketing-based employees currently working in those departments as they tend to have more robust networks of professionals with similar skills.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Know When to be Flexible<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]When it comes to hiring for emerging tech-based skill sets or marketing automation tech expertise, the talent with the exact requirements and experience you&#8217;re looking for may not exist just yet. This is why it&#8217;s critical to understand when is the right time to be flexible\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mondo.com\/blog-adjust-hiring-criteria-tech-roles\/\">adjust your hiring criteria<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, high-end Tech talent tends to have an array of educational backgrounds, which doesn&#8217;t mean one background is better than another. While you may be looking for an applicant with a 4-year degree, the skills developed in that setting\u00a0can also be developed in a less formal setting, like an online program or through\u00a0other certification methods. Rather than having a vacant role stay open for months on end and paying the price of doing so,\u00a0identify when more flexibility is the right strategy. Flexibility when hiring, when done right, will speed up your hiring process without negatively impacting the quality of hires.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Take Chances But Know When to Trust Your Gut<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Along\u00a0with being more flexible regarding hiring criteria, consider interviewing applicants you may not consider to be the best fit\u00a0initially based on what you learn about them on paper. While clients we partner with can be reluctant to interview certain candidates because they may not seem like a culture fit on paper or don&#8217;t have certain skills outlined in their resume, they come to find that the candidates are in fact a better fit than the individuals they were bringing in selectively.<\/p>\n<p>When turning down applicants for interviews, reconsider the reasoning behind the decisions and take more chances earlier on. You&#8217;ll provide yourself with a wider variety of candidates to choose from that may bring skill sets or expertise you hadn&#8217;t considered previously. However, in the same vein, for an efficient and faster hiring process, you also need to know when to trust your gut. In-demand Tech and Digital marketing talent\u00a0are never on the market long. If you interview a candidate you think is the right fit, but want to continue interviewing in case a better option is out there, you risk losing out on the initial candidate to a competitor who\u00a0recognizes top talent when they see it and provides an offer immediately. The last thing you want to do is let qualified\u00a0candidates slip through your fingers and be left with a role you&#8217;re unable to fill.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Outsource Your Hiring\u00a0Need<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]If you can&#8217;t afford a hiring process that lasts anywhere from 23.8 days, which is the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/research\/time-to-hire-in-25-countries\/\">current US average<\/a>\u00a0according to Glassdoor, to 94 days, which is the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/content\/dam\/Deloitte\/us\/Documents\/manufacturing\/us-manufacturing-industrial-products-09302014.pdf\">average length<\/a>\u00a0for highly skilled Tech roles according to Deloitte, then outsourcing your hiring need may be\u00a0your best option on how to speed up your hiring process. The reason more and more companies are turning to staffing agencies to fill their available Tech and Digital Marketing roles is due to the rapid speed specialized staffing agencies, like Mondo,\u00a0can fill the position, thanks to their exclusive networks of both active and passive in-demand talent.<\/p>\n<p>Outsourcing the need eliminates the possibility that your hiring process will go on for weeks, months, or even years, and frees up your hiring managers to focus on their critical day-to-day tasks rather than spending time reviewing piles of resumes and following up with skills-based test assignments. It also increases the likelihood that the vacancy will be filled since staffing agencies have developed relationships with high-end, niche talent that can&#8217;t be found on the market.<\/p>\n<p>Speeding up your hiring process is a proven strategy that yields access to higher quality hires, savings on related costs and resources, potentially higher acceptance rates, and enables you to net high-end talent faster.
