Discover the strategies you&#8217;ve been looking for on how to transform your\u00a0frankenstack\u00a0into an effective, fully-functioning, and automated MarTech stack, sourced from our exclusive\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/mondo.com\/resources-2018-martech-guide\/\">2018 MarTech Strategy Guide<\/a>.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h2>So You Have a Frankenstack<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Coming to terms with the fact that you have a\u00a0frankenstack\u00a0on your hands is no easy task. The\u00a0idea of having to rebuild your MarTech stack likely causes thoughts of massive\u00a0costs for new solutions, retraining your team, lost time researching which new tools should be added, and a headache of trying to decipher exactly what stack structure would be best for your needs. We get it, but the good news is that this doesn&#8217;t have to be your future. There are ways to minimize the cost of transforming your\u00a0frankenstack\u00a0into an effective stack that drives revenue, boosts conversions, and fully automates and personalizes the customer experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Before you do anything to your\u00a0frankenstack, the first step should be\u00a0to hire an expert to oversee all MarTech stack decisions moving forward. While a full-time or permanent hire, like a Chief\u00a0Marketing Technologist, might not be an option for your business, there are more affordable solutions like hiring a MarTech consultant or MarTech Architect for short-term or project-based needs as they arise. The reason securing a MarTech decision-maker is so crucial is because these individuals have the skills and expertise\u00a0necessary to understand the needs of your Marketing team and\u00a0customer personas and match them with the corresponding tech-based solutions that will provide the automated, data-driven results you&#8217;re missing.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>How to Transform Your\u00a0Frankenstack<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Once you&#8217;ve made your\u00a0MarTech decision-making hire, the next\u00a0strategy we recommend\u00a0is to collaborate with them to identify the gaps in your\u00a0frankenstack. Where are your solutions struggling to communicate? What manual data transferring are your employees doing that could be fully automated with the right integration of solutions? Identifying these issues or gaps in your ineffective MarTech stack will allow you to see where changes need to be made and which solutions offer the capabilities you&#8217;re currently lacking.<\/p>\n<p>Before replacing any solutions in your stack, however, connect with\u00a0the account managers or support staff of the solutions you&#8217;ve integrated to see if the solution is the\u00a0issue or if\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/reachforce.com\/blog\/8-ways-to-re-examine-your-martech-stack\/\">insufficient training<\/a>\u00a0is\u00a0causing your employees to use the tool ineffectively. Insufficient training is a much simpler problem to fix and can easily be solved by bringing in a solution expert to adequately train your team on how to best use the tool.<\/p>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve identified the problematic solutions and resolved the insufficient training that led to your\u00a0frankenstack, it&#8217;s time to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/chiefmartec.com\/2018\/01\/3-new-years-resolutions-martech-stack-2018\/\">rationalize your MarTech stack<\/a>. The best strategy for doing so can be to collaborate with your MarTech Architect and have them build out a visual of your stack. Seeing all of your solutions and how they integrate visually will\u00a0better showcase any duplicate solutions and allow you to consider the role they play in your Marketing department and evaluate whether\u00a0they are crucial to\u00a0maintain.<\/p>\n<p>After identifying the solutions that need replacing, rely on your MarTech hire, whether that&#8217;s a MarTech Architect or Marketing Technologist, to provide you with solution recommendations that\u00a0provide an enhanced customer experience while still providing your team with the automation, communication, and data-driven capabilities you need to enhance your Marketing campaigns and drive results in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>The importance of an effective MarTech stack in today&#8217;s personalization-driven marketing landscape cannot be overstated. To compete with other enterprise-level companies in your industry, it&#8217;s crucial to recognize an ineffective stack and then implement these strategies to transform your\u00a0frankenstack\u00a0into a well thought out MarTech stack that best meets your evolving marketing needs.<\/p>\n<p>If you lack the MarTech talent you need to transform your\u00a0frankenstack,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/mondo.com\/hire-martech-consultants\/\">contact Mondo<\/a>\u00a0today.
