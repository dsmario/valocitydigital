This particular attack provides insight into how governments, globally, view\u00a0cyberattacks.

Uncovering your business&#8217;s weak spots can help you understand what kind of security strategies would be the most effective. Discovering your vulnerabilities also allows you to look for tech talent with the corresponding cybersecurity knowledge and specialization. You wouldn&#8217;t want someone who excels in data breaches to be in charge of dismantling a ransomware attack, right? Find your weak points and seek out the tech consultant that has extensive experience in this area.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Incentivize Millennial Talent.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking to the new generation for cybersecurity grants you the opportunity to onboard candidates with fresh perspectives, the latest cybersecurity knowledge and a social media-centric lifestyle that will help your company not only reach new consumer groups but provide cyber protection against\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mondo.com\/blog-social-cyberattacks\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">emerging social media-based cyberattacks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Many industry leaders such as Google and Facebook have found success in fostering new work climates which have helped them appeal to the millennial generation and fill the security positions needed to prevent and recover from malware, phishing, and cryptojacking. If you\u2019re looking to net the most in-demand cybersecurity talent with the latest expertise, then you\u2019ll need to entice and incentivize that talent by providing benefits and the work culture they prioritize, like leading Tech giants have done.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Utilize a Cybersecurity-Focused Hiring Manager.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike many fields, the Tech industry is one where many standardized HR rules won&#8217;t necessarily guarantee the best candidate gets the job. The hiring techniques used to find your team&#8217;s Project Manager won&#8217;t be useful when looking to fill your business&#8217;s Security roles because the hiring process\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.darkreading.com\/threat-intelligence\/cybersecuritys-broken-hiring-process-\/d\/d-id\/1330104?piddl_msgorder=asc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">needs to be adjusted<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To sum it up, the hiring manager overseeing your cybersecurity hires needs to be a cybersecurity expert. Although your HR team might pass on a candidate due to poor interview skills, a well-seasoned Tech hiring manager would know to overlook poor interviewing abilities for a candidate with the rare cybersecurity experience and knowledge that would make them an ideal addition to your defense team.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Outsource the Hiring Process.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you know, the hiring process can utilize vast amounts of your company&#8217;s valuable time and resources, and most businesses can\u2019t afford to dedicate the time it takes to find the right hire. Outsourcing the entire hiring process to a staffing agency, like Mondo, can be\u00a0one of the most effective cybersecurity hiring strategies when you have an urgent need. Our average time-to-fill rates of 3 to 5 days for contract-based positions and 5 to 10 days for full-time roles can provide you with security talent you need as soon as you need it. Outsourcing this process allows your company to focus on what matters most: providing quality services and solutions to your customers and generating more revenue.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your company is in need of cybersecurity talent to protect and defend your most valuable assets,\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mondo.com\/contact\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contact Mondo<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0today.
