When handed a task that has been AI-powered, your talent is more likely to develop <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/diginomica.com\/2018\/02\/21\/beware-the-ai-risks-of-over-automation-and-hyper-convenience\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cognitive carelessness<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; similar to the impact of pilots and drivers who start to solely rely on a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ntsb.gov\/news\/press-releases\/Pages\/PR20170912.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vehicle\u2019s autopilot<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feature. In other words, automation complacency will decrease your production levels and ultimately hurt your bottom line; so it\u2019s important to stress this and educate your employees on the risk of relying too heavily on AI solutions. <\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><strong>Consumer Frustration.<\/strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even those outside of the Tech industry have more than likely come interacted with a chatbot or automated call attendant by now.

So despite the business risks of over-automation, the answer isn&#8217;t as simple as not using this emerging Tech considering the productivity, efficiency, and other business benefits it can offer. Instead, your company must find innovative ways to attract and retain the right ML experts who can help you successfully incorporate AI technologies.
