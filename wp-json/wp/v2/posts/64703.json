Computers and networks that haven&#8217;t updated their systems and those utilizing older versions of Windows are still at risk and make up the victims of the attack.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the latest updates your business needs to know regarding the WannaCry cyberattack:[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-unlock&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 150 countries and 300,000 computers have been infected.<\/li>\n<li>The spread of the ransomware seems to be slowing now that Microsoft has publicized the patch that eliminates the Windows 10 vulnerability hackers were targeting.\u00a0Following the attack, Microsoft also took the &#8220;highly unusual step&#8221; of releasing a <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2017\/04\/15\/technology\/microsoft-patch-shadow-brokers\/index.html?iid=EL\">patch<\/a> for its older operating systems the ransomware\u00a0was targeting as well.\n<ul>\n<li>These patches do nothing for computers already infected with WannaCry.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Hackers have only managed to net $80,000 from victims.<\/li>\n<li>Shadow Brokers, the hacking group believed to be behind the leak of NSA cyber spying tools used in WannaCry, announced via blog their plans to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/16\/ransomware-wannacry-nsa\/\">sell other stolen NSA cyber tools<\/a>\u00a0to fellow hackers in a subscription-based service starting in June.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]The most important update following the WannaCry hack is the potential for Shadow Brokers to distribute more cyber spying tools they claim were sourced from the NSA. This update is the one\u00a0business\u00a0owners and execs should be most concerned with. The potential release of more cyber spying tools developed by the NSA threatens the cybersecurity of every business, regardless of size. It has also stoked the debate regarding whether governments should be allowed to create such tools due to the ability of hackers to steal and leak them.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft execs responded to the massive cyberattack by calling again for a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.microsoft.com\/on-the-issues\/2017\/02\/14\/need-digital-geneva-convention\/#sm.00000902ehpcve1e10egcsfr85cgb\">Digital Geneva Convention<\/a>&#8221; to commit governments to protecting civilians and companies from nation-state cyberattacks\u00a0and the need for enhanced cybersecurity efforts globally considering the sharp rise in cyberattacks\u00a0over the past year.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>Adylkuzz: Ongoing Cyberattack Even Worse Than WannaCry<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While WannaCry was the attack on every major news outlet this weekend, it&#8217;s the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/adylkuzz-hack-larger-than-wannacry-slows-computers-nsa\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">silent, but larger cyberattack<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> known as Adylkuzz that has our attention. This lesser known cyberattack, identified by the security company Proofpoint, utilizes the same NSA tools used by WannaCry and has 20 servers around the world scanning for computers that don&#8217;t have the latest Microsoft patch in order to infect these devices. Hackers then infect the targeted computers with Adylkuzz <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/new-type-of-ransomware-could-infect-computer-without-even-clicking\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">without needing the owner to click<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A frightening development which could have disastrous repercussions if spread among the dark web hacking community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proofpoint was able to track the Adylkuzz program back to at least May 2, but believes it could have been around since April 24 and there is no way to tell how many computers have been infected. Proofpoint said potentially hundreds of thousands of PCs and servers could be infected. The hack is just now coming to light due to its stealthy nature. Infected computers show minimal signs of the hack, like slower performance speeds on PCs and a loss of specific Windows products. However, business networks with thousands of infected computers will experience severely slower speeds affecting their ability to do business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Adylkuzz program targets computers in order to turn them into a &#8220;mine&#8221; for Montero, which is a cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin, to generate thousands of dollars for the hackers behind the attack. Thus making victims into the unwitting financial supporters of their attackers. And unlike WannaCry, this attack is generating thousands and thousands of dollars for those responsible for it with no end point in sight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>How to Protect Your Business<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Now that you have the facts, it&#8217;s time to get smart about your cybersecurity initiatives and efforts to stop cyberattacks before they cost your business valuable resources.

This is crucial to have your IT team implement as soon as possible if your business devices are outdated or any devices have failed to update their Windows software in the past two months. This will protect your devices from the WannaCry ransomware, as well as Adylkuzz, by eliminating the Windows vulnerability utilized by both attacks to infect devices.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Develop and implement regular cybersecurity\u00a0training sessions.\u00a0<\/strong>Your biggest cybersecurity threat is your employees. Failing to update the Windows software on a single device leaves your company vulnerable to hacks like WannaCry. By developing and implementing regular cybersecurity training sessions led by your IT team, your business can drastically reduce the likelihood of experiencing a successful cyberattack.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hire the cybersecurity talent you need.\u00a0<\/strong>Having a robust IT team with skilled, experienced cybersecurity professionals is your company&#8217;s best defense against growing cybersecurity threats. These experts are in top demand considering the rise in cyberattacks over the past few years, so expect to pay a premium for this invaluable talent.
