(If your business currently utilizes the H-1B visa program, stay tuned. Changes to that program are up next in Congress and discussed below.)[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>Why New Immigration Legislation Matters to Tech Talent Diversity<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Tech execs, like yourself, were some of the first to address the immigration reform order that temporarily stopped the admission of refugees, indefinitely banned the admission of Syrian refugees, and\u00a0halted the admission of all citizens, including green card and visa holders, of seven countries, which have been noted as Muslim-majority countries, for at least the next 90 days.<\/p>\n<p>Why so concerned? Well, it turns out the immigration changes affect current employees at numerous tech companies, not to mention the tech talent they are forced to recruit internationally due to severe tech talent shortages in the U.S. Several major U.S. tech companies sent out memos to their employees addressing the new immigration policy and\u00a0instructed employees that are citizens of the banned countries\u00a0not to leave the country, while also offering legal support to those already outside the U.S. when the order was released. Companies like Apple and Microsoft also discussed the importance of immigration to their company\u2019s future, as well as the nation\u2019s future, in their memos following the immigration order and expressed disapproval of\u00a0the latest immigration restrictions.<\/p>\n<p>Why the rapid and mostly negative response? Due to the growing shortage of high-end, qualified tech talent in the U.S., a majority of Fortune 500 tech companies\u00a0rely on international recruitment to find the tech professionals they need. This is because the level of tech talent found in other countries dramatically eclipses the talent found stateside. And this trend shows no signs of stopping since our current tech educational programs and efforts are years behind other leading countries. Additionally, immigrants not only make up a significant portion of the tech talent found in the U.S., but many of the most successful and ground-breaking U.S. tech companies are <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/01\/30\/tech-immigrant-founders\/\">founded and run by immigrants<\/a> or the children of immigrants. This robust list includes the following\u00a0companies:[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Augmented Intelligence\u00a0in Business<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]When the conversation is changed from artificial intelligence to augmented intelligence, the possibilities for business uses expand exponentially with only a temporary disruptive effect on the workforce rather than a permanent, disastrous effect. Instead of thinking about how autonomous robots can help your business, it turns into how AI-driven technologies and tools can augment the work of your employees to increase efficiency and improve productivity.<\/p>\n<p>Augmented intelligent systems have already been implemented at a large number of both large and small businesses. With everything from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/robots-future-marketing-automation-technology\/\" target=\"_blank\">AI-driven marketing automation technologies<\/a> to enhanced data analytics systems, it\u2019s likely your business is already using some form of augmented intelligence technology. Businesses that\u00a0have yet to adopt AI-driven tools or are slower to adopt them will be outpaced rapidly by those that do.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, while this partnership between AI technologies and people will still disrupt some jobs, it will overall present opportunities for job growth, higher productivity, and higher earnings for individuals and businesses in every industry. It will also open entirely new sectors of jobs for those specializing in augmented intelligence systems.[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tesla\/SpaceX.<\/strong>\u00a0Elon Musk, the founder of both Tesla and SpaceX, immigrated to the U.S. after growing up in South Africa.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Google.<\/strong>\u00a0Sergey Brin, one of the co-founders of Google, immigrated to the U.S. with his parents from the Soviet Union to escape the discrimination they suffered as Jews.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reddit.<\/strong>\u00a0Alexis Ohanian, the founder of Reddit, is the son of a refugee who fled Armenia.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Amazon.<\/strong>\u00a0Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, whose stepfather was an immigrant from Cuba.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Yahoo.<\/strong>\u00a0Jerry Yang, the co-founder and former CEO of Yahoo, immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan.<\/li>\n<li><strong>eBay.<\/strong>\u00a0Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, was born in Paris to\u00a0two parents from Iran, which is one of the countries whose citizens are currently banned from entering the U.S.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Apple.<\/strong>\u00a0Steve Jobs, the co-founder and former CEO of Apple, was raised by his adoptive mother who is the\u00a0daughter of Armenian immigrants.

In short, a lot. For starters, companies like Microsoft\u00a0have at least 76 employees directly affected by these new rules. If these employees are barred from entering the U.S., it could cause immediate talent gaps on crucial teams that the U.S. cannot fill due to a lack of skilled tech talent and inadequate tech educational programs at the high school and collegiate-level to develop new tech talent.<\/p>\n<p>Also, a ban on any citizen from the seven countries listed in the order eliminates your ability to recruit promising tech talent from those areas. Since the U.S. already has a significantly lower amount of graduates in science, math, and computing, tech companies like yours rely on the wealth of skilled candidates from other countries to succeed in an increasingly competitive and tech-driven marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>While this order will force companies to consider more U.S. talent or talent from non-restricted areas,\u00a0there is no way to measure how much tech companies will lose by limiting the tech talent they have access to, especially considering the small tech talent pool currently available in the U.S. It could mean the loss of an innovative new product, technology, or software. Or, it could mean overall business earnings far less than what they could\u2019ve been.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the immigration reform the U.S. Government has already instated, a new bill looking to reform the H-1B visa program could also directly affect tech talent diversity. The proposed bill seeks to potentially lower the total amount of highly coveted H-1B visas available,\u00a0raise the minimum salary of H-1B visa holders from $60,000 to $130,000, and require companies to offer vacant positions to an equally qualified American worker before seeking an H-1B visa holder, among many other changes.<\/p>\n<p>While these potential changes are alarming to companies dependent on H-1B workers for their tech talent needs, it has only been introduced to Congress and will likely undergo considerable changes before implementation. Also, it\u2019s important to note that the intent behind the H-1B reform is to confront and reduce the abuse of the program by companies trying to exploit foreign workers and avoid regulations associated with American workers.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;3&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Looking Ahead<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]The future of tech talent diversity in the U.S. will be dependent on how current and future immigration reform is developed and executed.
