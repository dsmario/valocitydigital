The Agent of Excellence is someone who exemplifies what it means to be an Agent of Change, lives and breathes MAP, drives innovation, and helps shape our Mondo culture. Here\u2019s a look at what we learned by sitting down with this month\u2019s Agent of Excellence, Mark Kindy.<\/span>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out the following Q&amp;A to learn more about Mark, what motivates him, and what he loves most about working at Mondo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>How has Mondo helped you become the professional you are today?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI know when I started off at Mondo, I was still pretty junior in terms of work experience overall; Mondo really showed me how to hold myself accountable on a day-to-day basis. I\u2019ve learned that what business comes down to is facts, making things happen, and the importance in building the relationships surrounding that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>What makes Mondo stand out compared to your previous employers?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are two things that make Mondo differ. First is that there\u2019s a completely different tone once you walk into Mondo. Everyone is extremely positive and wants to help one another. Second, everyone here is very real about what\u2019s going on, no matter if it\u2019s positive or negative, and that\u2019s not something I had experienced previously.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>Based on your experience in a sales roles what advice would you give to new employees just joining Mondo?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think my advice would be to make sure that you\u2019re making the most of every day and that you\u2019re working as smart as you are hard. Beyond that, realize that it all comes down to making sure you\u2019re asking for help when you need it and believe in what you\u2019re doing.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;3&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row row_height_percent=&#8221;35&#8243; back_image=&#8221;67235&#8243; parallax=&#8221;yes&#8221; overlay_color=&#8221;color-jevc&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;25&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;4&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243;][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; position_vertical=&#8221;middle&#8221; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1560875735436{padding-right: 25px !important;padding-left: 25px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-gyho&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMark\u2019s stats speak for themselves \u2014 He was placed in the top 10 recruiters of Mondo nation and already has two promotions under his belt!
