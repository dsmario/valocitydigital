If you can, always make the domain name your name. This guarantees your portfolio will be displayed on the first page of Google&#8217;s search results whenever a potential employer or recruiter searches your name, which is the entire goal of building a professional brand.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<a href=\"http:\/\/dunked.com\/\"><strong>Dunked<\/strong><\/a>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Similar to Squarespace, Dunked is a platform where business professionals can create and host an online portfolio for a small monthly fee. However, it&#8217;s more geared toward a visual and artistic experience, so it&#8217;s the perfect platform for Developers, Designers, or Engineers. Users can easily display the apps, software, or programs they&#8217;ve created along with screenshots, analytics, and information about the development process. This is an incredible way to present the intangible aspects of a more creative or visually-driven career all in one place.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.com\/\"><strong>WordPress<\/strong><\/a>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]In order to be found online by employers, you must create content and blogging is one of the best ways to do so.

Which makes it even easier to be found organically by recruiters and employers. However, in order to improve your professional brand make sure you are creating valuable content because the last thing you want is to fill up the first page of Google&#8217;s search results for your name with\u00a0clickbait or listicles.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<strong>In Conclusion<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Competition in today&#8217;s marketplace is fierce. While professional branding has been around for a while, what&#8217;s changed is how to go about it.
