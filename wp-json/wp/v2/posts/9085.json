Already the home to major companies like Apple, Amazon, and GoDaddy, Phoenix is emerging as one of the fastest-growing digital marketing hotbeds in the country with a focus on the tech sector. Numerous advertising and digital marketing agencies are also headquartered in Phoenix, like Allison+Partners, Defero, and Off Madison Ave. The city is looking for digital marketing talent to fill managerial, Social Media Specialist, and Content Strategist roles.<\/li>\n<li><b>Charlotte:\u00a0<\/b>Another emerging hotbed of both digital marketing talent and digital marketing start-ups and business opportunities is Charlotte, NC. Currently, the city rounds out the list as one of the top cities for specialized SEO digital marketing roles, like\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/hire-seosem-analysts\/\">SEO\/SEM Analysts<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/hire-a-director-of-seosem\/\">Directors of SEO\/SEM<\/a>.

The interesting and artsy local scene of the Twin Cities metropolitan area continues to attract young digital marketing talent who flourish here given the fact that\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.spydertrap.com\/blog\/2015\/08\/outsiders-view-on-why-minneapolis-is-a-top-city-for-marketing-agencies\/\">17 Fortune 500\u2019s call this area home<\/a>, as well as major private companies like Mayo Clinic, providing endless digital marketing opportunities for creatives. Businesses in the area are currently looking to hire Digital Media Analysts and Digital Marketing Specialists.<\/li>\n<li><b>Indianapolis:\u00a0<\/b>Thanks to business-friendly policies that help incentivize entrepreneurs and a few major tech companies relocating to the area in recent years, Indianapolis has seen major growth as a digital marketing hotbed. One of the main areas of digital marketing focus in this geographic location is on measured marketing, so professionals with experience related to tracking and boosting engagement, like Social Media Managers and Email Marketing Specialists, are in high demand.<\/li>\n<li><b>Seattle:\u00a0<\/b>Seattle is another growing hotbed for tech marketing talent. The city attracts an ever-growing population of marketing talent year after year and is also an affordable location for startups in comparison to more competitive and expensive hotbeds like Silicon Valley, New York City, and San Francisco. More and more millennials have relocated to Seattle since it has garnered a reputation as a cheap and comparable alternative to one of the larger cities in the U.S. and boasts a favorable job market. The city is currently hiring Digital Marketing\u00a0Coordinators and Visual Designers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Proper preparation and an understanding of the top data security threats are a necessity in today&#8217;s global marketplace.
