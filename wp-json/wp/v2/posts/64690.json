It&#8217;s an alarming report on the initial read, but\u00a0its main point is more positive with a focus on how to improve diversity and tech retention rates across the industry. To do so, we all must better understand what is driving top tech talent away, especially diverse tech talent, and what steps can be taken to build and retain more satisfied, effective, and diverse tech teams.<\/p>\n<p>To help you better understand what could be contributing to the high turnover in tech and how you can go from being part of the problem to part of the solution for the larger tech community, we identified the top insights from the report and provide possible solutions\u00a0on how to eliminate the most significant tech retention threat to your workforce: employee mistreatment.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>The Impact of Employee Mistreatment on Tech Retention<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Thanks to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kaporcenter.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/KAPOR_Tech-Leavers-17-0428.pdf\">first-of-its-kind report<\/a> by Kapor, entitled &#8220;Tech Leavers Study,&#8221; we now know employee mistreatment is the driving force behind why many tech employees voluntarily chose to leave their highly paid jobs. The report surveyed around 2,000 current and former tech employees on why they voluntarily left jobs in tech and provides a\u00a0first-ever look at the true causes of decreased retention rates in tech as compared to other industries.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the\u00a0main takeaways:[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-thumbs-o-down&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workplace experiences in tech differ dramatically by race, gender, and social orientation.<\/li>\n<li>Mistreatment, identified in the survey as discrimination, sexual harassment, bullying, and unfair people management, is the main cause of turnover in tech.<\/li>\n<li>Conservative estimates put the cost of employee mistreatment alone at <strong>$16B annually<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Diversity in tech will remain impossible unless mistreatment of employees is addressed and solved.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]Here are additional stats from the report that showcase the experience of tech employees:[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-thumbs-o-down&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>37% of respondents cited mistreatment or unfairness as their reason for leaving.<\/li>\n<li>78% reported they\u00a0had experienced some form of mistreatment.<\/li>\n<li>85% reported they\u00a0witnessed unfair treatment happen to a co-worker.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/feature\/nbc-out\/bullying-driving-lgbtq-people-out-tech-study-finds-n752646?cid=public-rss_20170429\">LGBTQ employees<\/a> are especially likely to quit jobs because of bullying in the workplace.\n<ul>\n<li>This group was the most likely to be bullied (20%) and experience public humiliation or embarrassment (24%) at work.<\/li>\n<li>64% reported bullying contributed to their decision to leave their employer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Women in tech are two times as likely to quit as men, while Latino and black employees are 3.5 times as likely to quit as their white or Asian colleagues.<\/li>\n<li>1 in 10 women reported experiencing unwanted sexual attention at work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]These stats highlight a core problem in the way we look at talent diversity in tech. Previously, it was believed there simply wasn&#8217;t enough specialized tech talent stateside for companies to be able to hire a diverse tech workforce, which is a problem that would take decades to resolve by improving tech education programs and funding for these programs.<\/p>\n<p>However, the report points to the treatment of these underrepresented groups as the main contributor to the disparity between\u00a0the number of white, male tech workers and\u00a0the number of female and minority tech workers. In order for the tech industry to become more diverse, we all must focus on improving the treatment of diverse talent in the workplace.\u00a0While this is in no way good news, it is a problem we can solve by coming together as a community rather than one that would take decades to solve.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>How to\u00a0Build &amp; Retain Diverse Tech Teams<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]The tech industry, as you know, is not a lazy environment. Working for a forward-thinking tech business often means long hours, constant innovation, and competitive work environments. After all, these are the elements that drive innovation at tech leaders like Google and Amazon and workers are compensated well for the work they put in (Average salary of Silicon Valley engineers starts at $200,000). But paying well is not the solution to the industry&#8217;s retention problem.<\/p>\n<p>Major tech giants like Uber,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/08\/16\/technology\/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html\">Amazon<\/a>, Oracle, and Google have had high-profile controversies regarding the treatment of employees. As these controversies emerged, they were treated as isolated incidents. But in reality, it appears these problems are more widespread than we thought. Which means it&#8217;s time for the tech community to come together to solve these issues and build more productive, satisfied, successful, and diverse teams of tech experts.<\/p>\n<p>So, how can we, tech companies, improve?
