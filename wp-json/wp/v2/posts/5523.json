I\u2019ve always liked to build and create, and I learned so much about so many things while at Quirky. I was involved in all different kinds of projects there, so being in the thick of it was the ultimate training system for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>Custom earphones in 48 hours, that\u2019s fast! Do you think this plays into a larger trend of consumers wanting everything \u201con demand\u201d and personally tailored to them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>NIKKI:\u00a0<\/strong>Absolutely! It\u2019s my belief that everyone wants what they want, how and when they want it. Customers are rejecting the generic right now. Customization is huge, and they want products built specifically for them. Right now it\u2019s earphones, but there\u2019s no telling how far this can and will go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>As a brand, Normal feels very cool and innovative. How did you go about creating an image for your brand?<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>NIKKI:\u00a0<\/strong>When I first had the idea for Normal I immediately jumped in with building the brand. Even before I made any money I knew how important it was to create an image. I needed my initial customers to take in our image as a whole, and trust in us as a brand before we could grow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Before Normal there was no easy way to buy customer earphones. To get a pair you had to shell out $2,000 and go to a specialist who would take a mold while you clenched your jaw for ten minutes. We needed to position ourselves as a fun, approachable alternative to that, and needed a distinct image in order to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>Where do you see the future of 3-D printing?<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>NIKKI:\u00a0<\/strong>Right now Normal is the only company mass-producing a custom consumer good using 3-D printing. I\u2019m not able to give details at this time, but we\u2019re currently working on other custom products that I\u2019m extremely proud of. I\u2019m thrilled with where we\u2019re going, and hope other companies come on board to further the industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>As former leaders at Quirky, you and your husband Ben must be an amazingly creative &amp; innovative team. How does this this translate to your lives outside of the office?<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>NIKKI:\u00a0<\/strong>Ben and I learn a lot from each other. We approach things very differently, and our strengths are completely opposite, but that\u2019s what makes us a great team. We each bring something different to the table and help balance one another out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>Do you have a traditional STEM education background?<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>NIKKI:\u00a0<\/strong>Having studied Public Policy at Princeton I certainly don\u2019t have a traditional STEM education. When I started working at Quirky I decided to take a few engineering classes so as to better understand the products i was working with. I also took classes in basic HTML, CSS, and Photoshop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">At Normal I always want to understand our products on a more in-depth level. I\u2019m hiring engineers, so I need to at least understand the rudimentary techniques in play. I\u2019ve also learned a ton from watching the physical products be made in the factories, which has given me an awesome hands-on education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>MONDO:\u00a0<\/strong>As a female entrepreneur in the tech industry do you have any advice for other women looking to start their own technology businesses?<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>NIKKI:\u00a0<\/strong>My advice for women is the same as my advice for men. If you have an idea and truly believe in it, you need to get the word out there. Ideas don\u2019t do anything in your head. Start talking about it at brunch, at cocktails, at dinner- if it\u2019s a strong idea to you, it will likely resonate with others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Really passion is everything. The highs are high, but the lows are really low so your heart needs to be in it. It\u2019s a hard business but there\u2019s a ton of room for great ideas to turn into reality with hard work and perseverance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><i>To learn more about Normal &amp;\u00a0order your own custom set of\u00a0headphones, visit their website.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243;
