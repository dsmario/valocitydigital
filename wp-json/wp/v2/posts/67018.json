However, you\u2019re more likely to invest in this demographic once you learn that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.techrepublic.com\/article\/how-gen-z-will-reshape-the-workforce-80-want-to-work-with-cutting-edge-tech\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">98 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of those from Gen Z who took a Dell Technologies survey claimed they were using technology as a part of their everyday formal education, unlike their predecessors who didn\u2019t possess the same access to this technology. Looking for better digital transformation initiatives? 73 percent of the same participants rated their Tech literacy above good or excellent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Pew Research Center, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewinternet.org\/fact-sheet\/mobile\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">95 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Americans own cell phones, which is why businesses outside of the Tech realm are discovering the importance of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mondo.com\/blog-mobile-marketing-strategies\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobile marketing strategies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

If your company isn&#8217;t sure where or how to start, consider implementing these practical tips to help you net the Gen Z talent you&#8217;ll need: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Educate, Don\u2019t Sell<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Recruitment Manager at Addison Group, Katie Kochmond, told Entrepreneur that she\u2019s realized college students and recent grads engage better when recruiters <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/314061\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">educate them<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on a company\u2019s brand and mission, rather than selling the business to them. Kochmond went on to say, \u201cThis allows them to come to the conclusion if it is the best fit for them on their own.\u201d If you want to recruit college grads your business will need to allow these recent grads to shadow employees, be transparent about your work culture, and clearly emphasize that your company can help them achieve both their professional and personal goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Utilize Social Media<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, 95 percent of Gen Z\u2019s cell phones are smartphones, which means you\u2019ll need to meet your potential employees where they spend most of their time. To successfully recruit in-demand talent from this demographic your company will need to promote your brand and culture across your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90315379\/how-to-attract-and-retain-generation-z-employees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">social networks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to catch the eye of the college grads you\u2019re looking to hire. Regularly updating your company\u2019s Twitter, Instagram, and even YouTube is a great way to show this group why they\u2019d want to join your workforce and also highlight the open positions they\u2019d be interested in filling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Enhance Your Work Experience<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you know how to educate rather than sell and properly network across your social channels you will improve your business\u2019 ability to attract and retain Gen Z talent. Another way to recruit college grads is to enhance your overall <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.franchising.com\/articles\/hiring_in_2019_gen_z_and_hourly_employment_trends.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work experience<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Unlike baby boomers, this generation cares more about work-life balance. Creating a better employee experience can be done by changing PTO policies, offering better benefits, and respecting those who take time off, and adopting a system that trains teams not to communicate with co-workers during their days off. You\u2019ll see job satisfaction rates improve amongst current employees and attract the Tech savvy college grads you\u2019re looking to onboard. <\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;0&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With emerging tech continually evolving, your business will want to recruit from this group of self-starters, who are currently still being shaped by things previous generations didn\u2019t experience until much later, like, social media, mobile marketing, and pressing international issues.
