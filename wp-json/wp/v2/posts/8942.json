Although the importance of content creation in growing your reach and consumer base hasn&#8217;t lessened, forward-thinking businesses have shifted to prioritizing content strategies that will help them become a thought leader in their industry rather than content strategies that focus solely on SEO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Due to these changing SEO trends, algorithm updates, and the rising demand from consumers for insightful content, a majority of <\/span>mangement<span style=\"color: #000000;\">-level respondents reported in Mondo&#8217;s Digital Marketing Survey that creating quality content was the top priority for their digital marketing strategy. In addition to that, nearly 82 percent of digital marketers are putting more value on developing content for people rather than search engines, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.business2community.com\/infographics\/top-8-hottest-2016-content-marketing-trends-infographic-01443482#ZVHTF85MGAdH8FWf.97\">CJG Digital Marketing<\/a>. Which is a direct result of Google&#8217;s algorithm update to incorporate semantic technology, which focuses more on the intent behind the search query rather than finding set keywords.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">These statistics also go to show that the previous prioritization of content to boost search engine rankings is out and content that reinforces the\u00a0authoritative and thought leadership persona of a brand is in.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So how can you start establishing your brand as an authoritative thought leader in your industry and give users the content they are looking for?\u00a0Here&#8217;s an exclusive look at four effective content strategies businesses should implement to accomplish these goals based on insights gathered from our upcoming Digital Marketing Salary Guide:<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Tap Influencers:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Influencer marketing is a key element to developing authority and a thought leader persona for your business. Having other thought leaders in your industry create content that endorses your product or services is an excellent way to establish authority, garner social media attention, and tap into a larger audience. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/identifying-high-quality-influencers-vital-marketing-strategy\/\">Identifying quality influencers<\/a> is the crucial component to making this strategy effective, so be sure to allocate enough resources to do so successfully.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Prioritize Social Media Presence:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Establishing an engaging and reliable social presence allows your consumers a look at what is important to your brand, while still focusing on what is important to them. It\u2019s about prioritizing the development of your social platforms and maintaining those pages with regular posts, responses to consumer engagement, and sharing content your audience wants. This helps establish brand authority, which lends itself to thought leadership. Stay current with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/whats-next-social-media-strategy\/\">social media trends and developing platforms<\/a> to stay connected with and relevant to your target audience.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Pursue Publishing Opportunities:\u00a0<\/strong>Once you&#8217;ve elevated your blog content, establish a\u00a0content strategy around pursuing external publishing opportunities. You must find outlets besides your own website and social media pages where you can publish insightful content to really begin gaining traction as a thought leader. To do so, reach out to various industry-related blogs and authoritative sources and inquire about potential guest contributor opportunities weekly, if not daily. Look to get innovative content published on a wide range of sources to begin establishing yourself as a thought leader in the minds of as many readers as possible.<\/li>\n<li><b>Be Bold and Produce Insight:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0After implementing the above content strategies, you have effectively established your brand as an authority in your industry. Now, it&#8217;s time to cement your status as a thought leader by being bold when it comes to content creation and producing insight. Make bold claims and bigger predictions about the future of your industry in your content. Drive change and innovation. Consumers are looking for businesses with insight into what\u2019s coming next.
