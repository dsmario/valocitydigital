As we noted <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/wannacry-adylkuzz-cyberattack-updates\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last week<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it&#8217;s believed to be the largest online extortion ever carried out. But you might be surprised to learn about some of the wackiest WannaCry victims. (We know we were!) It turns out, these hackers were out to infect any vulnerable device they could find, which includes South Korean movie theaters. Go figure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here are all the best deets on the most unsuspecting WannaCry victims we&#8217;ve identified to show that no matter your business size, profession, or industry, hackers always go for the easiest targets.[\/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>The 5 Wackiest WannaCry Victims<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-unlock-alt&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>German commuters and travelers had an unanticipated travel delay once WannaCry infected the German rail operator, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-ca\/autos\/news\/renault-and-nissan-are-among-the-businesses-affected-by-massive-ransomeware-attack\/ar-BBBa1Gk\">Deutsche Bahn<\/a>. Some electronic signs announcing arrival and departure\u00a0information were infected with the ransomware and remained unusable as the network worked to resolve the hack. With no access to their network, a few stations resorted to using chalkboards for arrival and departure info. (Here&#8217;s hoping Grand Central took note and upgraded their security systems so we never endure this chalk-fueled fiasco&#8230;)<\/li>\n<li>Asia was one of the regions that experienced the most WannaCry-related cyberattacks. Out of the 40,000 institutions infected, around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/05\/19\/business\/hacking-malware-wanncry-ransomware-deadline.html\">4,000 of them<\/a> were universities or schools. Which means that the real WannaCry victims in these cases were students, many of whom reported being locked out of their thesis papers and dissertation presentations. A majority of the students affected never regained access to years worth of work. It definitely counts as wacky, but it&#8217;s also a nightmare we don&#8217;t wish on even our worst enemy.<\/li>\n<li>FedEx, one of the only U.S.-based businesses infected, makes this wacky list as well. The global shipping company reported interference with some of their electronic delivery systems which forced them to suspend their money-back guarantees for packages set for delivery on Saturday, May 13. (Bye bye guaranteed delivery dates!) Since the WannaCry cyberattack was launched the weekend of Mother&#8217;s Day, it looks like some Mother&#8217;s Day shipments didn&#8217;t make it to their destination on time. (PSA to ALL Moms: maybe the delay really wasn&#8217;t your kid&#8217;s fault this year?)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-cyber-attack-victims-idUSKCN18B1PX\">MediaOnline<\/a>, an operator of digital displays in Singapore shopping malls, figured out they were one of the WannaCry victims when some of their kiosks in two malls began displaying the ransomware&#8217;s pop-up window. Talk about awkward since no one wants to be caught advertising the ransomware that has attacked the entire globe.\u00a0It took some work, but the firm finally got their kiosks back under control. All mall patrons will now know exactly where to go, how to get there, and be able to do some choice window shopping. (Phew! We were worried for a second there.)<\/li>\n<li>Meanwhile, over in South Korea, consumers were rejoicing over the hack of CJ CGV Co., one of the country&#8217;s largest movie-theater chains. It turns out that WannaCry hackers actually did the moviegoers a favor by hacking the ad server and making it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-us\/money\/companies\/cyberattack-victims-begin-to-assess-financial-damage\/ar-BBB9puE?srcref=rss\">unable to play ads<\/a>\u00a0before the start of films at 30 locations. Because who really wants to sit through movie trivia, five coca-cola ads, and seven reminders not to text during the movie? Not us. In a predictable turn of events, the chain reported ticket sales were not affected. (Our bet is they went up.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Looking Ahead<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]While these WannaCry victims are pretty wacky, they are evidence of a very real threat\u00a0facing anyone who owns a laptop, computer, or smartphone.\u00a0Hackers target vulnerable devices and susceptible software regardless of business size, industry, or geo-location.
