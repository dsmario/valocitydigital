It takes months of planning, an effective,\u00a0tech-based Marketing team, collaboration with executives at your business, and alignment with your budget. However, even the best intentions can result in an ineffective hybrid stack, often labeled a &#8220;frakenstack.&#8221; Here&#8217;s how to find out if your pursuit of 1:1 consumer personalization resulted in the dreaded frankenstack\u00a0and what you can do about it, based on insights from our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/mondo.com\/resources-2018-martech-guide\/\">2018 MarTech Strategy Guide<\/a>.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>What is a Frankenstack?<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]To understand what a\u00a0frankenstack\u00a0is, you need to understand the three different types of MarTech stacks. The first option is to build a stack from scratch. Companies rarely elect this option since building tools from scratch is costly, time intensive, and tends to provide less ROI than solutions already available. It also makes much less sense\u00a0to go this route today since the MarTech solution industry has\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/chiefmartec.com\/2017\/05\/marketing-techniology-landscape-supergraphic-2017\/\">exploded in popularity<\/a>\u00a0in recent years, thus extremely targeted, effective tools now exist for every aspect of a Marketing team&#8217;s needs.<\/p>\n<p>The second option is to stitch together existing solutions to create a hybrid MarTech stack. Poor examples of this are where the term &#8220;frankenstack&#8221; comes from. These types of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.exchangewire.com\/blog\/2016\/03\/31\/are-you-in-danger-of-building-a-frankenstack\/\">ineffective hybrid stacks<\/a>\u00a0are a jumble of different Tech solutions that don&#8217;t work well together or provide Marketers with the results they need in time. The final option is to have a MarTech programmatic expert come in and develop the stack themselves from one platform to create a\u00a0fully managed service. Despite the fear of creating a\u00a0frankenstack, most Marketers tend to go with the hybrid option considering it often presents the best ROI.<\/p>\n<p>MarTech stacks and the strategy that goes into creating\u00a0these hybrid versions are still a concept a lot of Marketers are just beginning to fully understand, yet many have already integrated solutions in hopes of figuring it out along the way. In fact, 100 percent of Digital Marketing professionals we surveyed in our 2018 MarTech Strategy\u00a0Guide reported investing in 4 or more MarTech solutions, yet 66 percent reported being unable to take full advantage of\u00a0their current solutions. Unfortunately, this strategy actually sets Marketing departments back as\u00a0it requires time and money to review and revise a living MarTech stack. But before we skip ahead, the first step is figuring out if your business suffers from an ineffective stack.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few tell-tale signs to look out for.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h2>Signs Your MarTech Stack is a Frankenstack<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner column_width_percent=&#8221;90&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-close&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;color-210407&#8243;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your solutions can&#8217;t communicate.\u00a0<\/strong>A\u00a0major sign of an ineffective MarTech stack is if your tools are unable to communicate results, data, and information to one another. If solutions are structured ineffectively\u00a0or lack the capabilities to communicate their results to the other solutions in your stack, the data they gather and report on\u00a0gets\u00a0siloed.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hull.io\/blog\/stop-calling-it-a-marketing-stack\/\">Siloed\u00a0data<\/a>\u00a0means inaccessible\u00a0data. Not only will your Marketing team have to do a variety of manual, time-intensive tasks to get the data aggregated together but there are also other ROI-generating capabilities this data will be unable to provide.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your team lacks the necessary skills for the tools you&#8217;ve integrated.\u00a0<\/strong>An ineffective stack is also one that you&#8217;re unable to utilize fully. While hiring specific talent to make up for the MarTech skills gap on your team is one option, you should prioritize UX-friendly\u00a0solutions with capabilities you are easily able to take advantage of from the start. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll need to hire a variety of MarTech experts to help you make the best of your\u00a0frankenstack, dramatically\u00a0impacting your ROI.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Solutions selected initially weren&#8217;t an exact fit\u00a0for your needs.\u00a0<\/strong>When developing your stack, it might make sense to select solutions that weren&#8217;t an exact fit for your needs but were close enough.\u00a0If this sounds like something you did, it&#8217;s more than likely you have a\u00a0frankenstack\u00a0on your hands. The reason being that\u00a0you sacrificed core needs for something that provides similar results, but not the exact same. Predictive data analysis is a core fundamental of what your MarTech stack needs to provide. If the solutions you selected have data-aggregation or consumer behavior tracking capabilities that are only a bit off from what you needed, it can result in a nightmare of siloed data going to waste rather than providing your sales department with an automated, qualified lead pipe.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A majority of tasks are manual.<\/strong>\u00a0Automation is the future. Specifically, it&#8217;s the future of innovative, effective Marketing departments. Your MarTech stack should be the core provider of automation for your Marketing team. Everything from email campaigns, to deep lead qualification and maintaining a consumer database should now be automated\u00a0via an effective MarTech stack. If you find that a majority of your team&#8217;s tasks are manual, then you have an ineffective stack on your hands that needs a second look.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_column_text]Marketers looking to keep their jobs in an era of AI-driven automation must evaluate their use of marketing technology and\u00a0review the effectiveness of the stack they&#8217;ve developed. If any of the signs above sound familiar, it&#8217;s time to invest in making your stack as effective and revenue-driven as possible. If you don&#8217;t, you risk being\u00a0outperformed by the marketing teams at your competitors who have taken the time to invest, strategize around, and refine their MarTech stack.
