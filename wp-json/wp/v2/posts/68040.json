Whereas [with recruiters at other companies], they don\u2019t really care as much about you, they care more about themselves. So I found her to be really helpful and I enjoy working with her.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What has your experience been like working with other staffing agencies?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMondo is very straight up. Where others tend to do a lot of bait and switch.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What do you enjoy most about being a full-time consultant?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFull-time consulting gives me the flexibility to potentially work on multiple jobs or multiple gigs at one time so I can maximize the money that I make. It also gives me the flexibility to learn more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a consultant now, you usually have to put out a fire or you\u2019re being brought in for a specific ask and that\u2019s really it. Whereas a full-time person, you\u2019re coming in, you\u2019ve got time to learn the lay of the land, you\u2019ve got time to meet with stakeholders and all that. But as a consultant, you\u2019ve got to hit the ground running and I really enjoy that because it cuts out a lot of that noise that I don\u2019t really enjoy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What would you say you\u2019ve worked on that you are most proud of throughout your partnership with Mondo?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI would say the thing I\u2019m most proud of would probably be the Eversource project, they are an energy company based in the Northeast. I helped them migrate off of Coremetrics, which was purchased by IBM, and roll out Adobe Analytics tracking across their customer-facing site as well as their authenticated log-in site&#8230; Just getting that rolled out, which I think was around 4 months early.\u201d <\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;0&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;1&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h2><b>What Matters Most to Consultants<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<b>What criteria do you look for from potential employers during the interview process?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBefore, I used to have all of these criteria, work-life balance, transparency from the manager, and a seat at the table. Where now analytics and what I do isn\u2019t an afterthought, it\u2019s something that\u2019s included in the beginning. Nowadays, to be honest with you, I\u2019m really looking for someone to be honest and the role to be honest, whatever it is.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want me to mop floors, then that\u2019s what I do. If you want me to write code, I write code. I just want whatever it is, that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t try and do something where you bring me in and I now do X, but then someone leaves and now there\u2019s a need for me to do Y. And then it becomes a new responsibility without any kind of additional compensation. Or, it turns into, if I fail in that new role then I\u2019ll be blamed as if I was hired for that role, when instead I was just trying to help out. So it\u2019s a lot of that that I\u2019ve tried to eliminate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowadays, it\u2019s really more about can I do the role they are asking for? And are they going to be honest when I\u2019m in the role so I don\u2019t have to look over my shoulder or worry that they are going to be changing things in the eleventh hour?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Is there anything specific you do to prepare for interviews?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m very unique, where I don\u2019t prepare for interviews. Instead, I usually come into an interview cold and allow that hiring manager to steer the conversation. Do you want me to be more technical during this call or less technical? Do you want me to show you more of my soft skills or less of them? Do you want me to talk about my accolades or do you want me to really talk about what I can do for your organization? So I prefer to let them show me by what they are saying and what they\u2019re not saying and then go forward from there.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What interview advice would you give to other consultants or freelancers?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou have to remember there are other things outside of your purview that you have no control over. For example, your rate might be $65\/hour and [another candidate] is going up for the job and only wants $50\/hour. Budget could be more of an issue than what you know and now that $50 is more palatable because the client could apply those savings to an offshore resource and get more bang for their buck. Or maybe the client is talking to different agencies to fill this role as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a lot of moving parts you don\u2019t know about, so it\u2019s more about how to best set yourself up to be remembered, show the client you know your stuff and that you can do what they are asking you to do. And keep in mind, it\u2019s a numbers game so you\u2019ll have to throw a lot at the wall to see what sticks.\u201d <\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column column_width_percent=&#8221;80&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;1&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h2><b>Talking Trends<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dorian is a vetted Digital and Web Analytics expert with an insider\u2019s perspective on the latest trends within the niche specialization areas of web analytics and data science \u2014 both of which have exploded in value and demand in recent years as big data became accessible to companies of all sizes. With this in mind, we spoke with Dorian to get his thoughts on the latest trends he\u2019s seeing and what makes him a rare asset to any business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What would you say are the most in-demand skills for Digital\/Web Analytics experts?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s changing. If you asked me 10 years ago, I would\u2019ve said you really needed to know development \u2014 Javascript, HTML, CSS. Not necessarily being able to write it yourself, but be able to look at it, understand it, and tell someone who couldn\u2019t understand it or read it what was going on.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, I would say it\u2019s shifted. It\u2019s more soft skills and data science. That\u2019s the really big thing a lot of companies are looking to leverage this analytics data and create Mac models off of it to start creating forecasts based upon the data and the criteria they might be looking at. That\u2019s where I see the industry going, where my role shifts to become more of a Data Scientist\/ Analytics role and the pure analytics person, from a technical perspective, gets phased out. They are going to automate a lot of that work in Content Management Systems (CMS).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I think that is kind of where the industry is going. You\u2019ll have your analyst, but they\u2019ll become more junior. You\u2019ll get rid of your technical role as a full-time role, it will be more of a part-time role or ad hoc.
