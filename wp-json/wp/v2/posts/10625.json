Link stuffing has been done away with, and SEO and content marketing experts now know that link building, the process of getting external pages to link to the content on your website, is the newest priority. Here&#8217;s a look at the top strategies for link building you need to incorporate now to drive traffic to your content, as well as two outdated strategies to avoid.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<\/p>\n<h1>Proven Link Building Strategies That Drive Traffic:<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;color-210407&#8243;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Turn Mentions Into Backlinks.\u00a0<\/b>An excellent way to <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/32479\/32-White-Hat-Ways-to-Build-Inbound-Links.aspx?__hstc=46213176.61c63fb77a94bd15d135c8a0bdc4dcb4.1489081438259.1489081438259.1489081438259.1&amp;__hssc=46213176.11.1489081438260&amp;__hsfp=740420469#sm.001tvebaq1e6oezdsck1jlxlxzuon\">generate quality backlinks<\/a> to your website and boost your search page ranking, as well as traffic to your content and website, is to turn mentions of your content or your company into backlinks. Start by turning on Google Alerts for your top executives\u2019 names and your business name, as well as any recent, top performing blog titles, subjects, or content-driven assets. Whenever your business or a recently covered\u00a0content topic is mentioned, you\u2019ll receive an alert. Then you\u2019ll need to reach out to the website to\u00a0have links to your website, specific blog posts, or asset\u00a0download pages added into the mentions.<br \/>\nThis link building strategy is especially effective in driving traffic to your\u00a0latest content-driven assets and trending blog post topics since websites will be more apt to direct readers to these types of relevant resources.<\/li>\n<li><b>Test Out the SkyScraper Technique.<\/b> The <a href=\"http:\/\/backlinko.com\/skyscraper-technique\">Skyscraper Technique<\/a> refers to the process of evaluating a competitor\u2019s best assets and then creating a\u00a0better, more up-to-date, content-driven asset. Once you have completed the updated asset, then reach out to the websites that are already linking to the similar asset and request they update to your asset. Many websites comply so they can provide readers with the best, most informed asset available. Thus, driving traffic to your highest quality content.<\/li>\n<li><b>Reach Out to Influencers.\u00a0<\/b>Reach out to an influencer in your industry and see if they would be interested in contributing a blog to your website or highlighting a specific piece of your content\u00a0on their own website or social platforms. This not only creates an excellent opportunity for backlinking from their website and social platforms to yours and vice versa, but it also engages an entirely new audience, boosts conversions and search engine rankings for your business, and increases traffic to your content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>Link Building Strategies to Avoid:<\/b><\/span>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]While implementing proven link building strategies is crucial to driving traffic to your content, incorporating outdated or ineffective strategies can actually lower your search engine page ranking which prohibits your audience from reaching your content. To help you avoid lowering traffic to your content, here are two link building-related strategies\u00a0your business should never adopt:[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-close&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;color-210407&#8243;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><b><strong>Link stuffing.\u00a0<\/strong><\/b><\/b>As mentioned above, link stuffing has now been done away with. Before recent algorithm updates, search engines used to determine page ranks by identifying how many external links were included in the content on a web page. The more links you had, the better your ranking would be.<br \/>\nHowever, after realizing more links didn\u2019t necessarily constitute more authority on a topic, Google and other search engines quickly updated their algorithms to reflect this. Now search engines look for link stuffing and penalize web pages that incorporate it, so it\u2019s crucial your content marketers are setting limits on the number of quality external links added to their content.<\/li>\n<li><b>Linking to Low-Quality Websites.<\/b>\u00a0In addition to link stuffing, search engine algorithms now\u00a0look for content that links\u00a0to non-authoritative sources. Although it is important to add in links to generate authority on a given topic to\u00a0elevate your search engine page ranking for that content, thus driving more traffic to your content, you must ensure you are adding only high-quality links to authoritative sources. Failure to do so will damage your search engine ranking and decrease the visibility of your content online, limiting the number of consumers who will come across\u00a0it, which leads\u00a0to fewer conversions and lessened audience reach over time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading]<b>In Conclusion<\/b>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Now, your marketing team has the tools and knowledge it needs to elevate your content\u00a0marketing strategy.
