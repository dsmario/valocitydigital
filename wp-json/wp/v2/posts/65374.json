Here&#8217;s how to stand-out from fellow engineers, analysts, or developers\u00a0in the interview and guarantee a follow-up interview or offer.[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner column_width_percent=&#8221;90&#8243; gutter_size=&#8221;3&#8243; overlay_alpha=&#8221;50&#8243; medium_width=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_x=&#8221;0&#8243; shift_y=&#8221;0&#8243; z_index=&#8221;0&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-comments&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;color-210407&#8243;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read up on the company&#8217;s latest software release or Tech implementation.<\/strong>\u00a0Before you step foot in the interview, find out the latest updates on the company&#8217;s recent software release or Tech implementation. If the solution falls under your area of expertise, look into what types of recommendations you would give on how to improve it, better integrate it, or troubleshoot it. Present this information respectfully in the interview early-on to display your genuine interest in the business, your ability to analyze core business needs and provide Tech-driven solutions, and that this job isn&#8217;t one of many you&#8217;re applying to (even if it is). Your interviewer will\u00a0be impressed by your in-depth research, and it will help\u00a0showcase how your skill sets would immediately benefit the business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Speak to your experience.\u00a0<\/strong>One of the main pieces of feedback our recruiters receive from employers after a\u00a0candidate is passed on is that the candidate didn&#8217;t speak to their experience in the interview, aside from what was already represented on their resume. Although you&#8217;ll be interviewing with a fellow Tech expert and they&#8217;re likely familiar with your skills, they still want to understand the details and intricacies\u00a0of your process rather than being told which technologies or coding languages you are skilled in. Instead of stating you can automate using Puppet, slow down. Explain\u00a0<em>how<\/em>\u00a0you automate in Puppet and speak to the specific skills needed to do so. Unlike other types of interviews, Tech job interviews are not about selling yourself. Instead, it&#8217;s about speaking to your experience effectively and breaking down your processes in an understandable way.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Describe a Tech-based issue you faced &amp; how you overcame it.\u00a0<\/strong>It may be more cliche, but specifically highlighting a time in your professional experience when you were faced with a Tech-based issue or problem and explaining how you overcame it will help the interviewer identify you as an experienced problem-solver and an asset for any Tech department. Problem-solving is a key function of a majority of Tech jobs. Regardless of whether or not the interviewer asks, be sure to prepare and incorporate this answer into your interview at some point, even if that means tieing it into an answer to another question. While it may be more cliche, this continues to be one of the most crucial Tech interview tips\u00a0for a reason: it works.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Talk about your interests.<\/strong>\u00a0One of the best things about\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.monster.com\/career-advice\/article\/it-interview-tips\">interviewing for a Tech role<\/a>\u00a0is that your interviewer is a Tech professional as well, meaning you may share mutual interests. Whether you love talking about the latest Tech news, what HBO&#8217;s Silicon Valley gets right or wrong about the Tech\u00a0industry,\u00a0or the most recent Google Search algorithm update, this is your chance to speak to a fellow Tech expert with similar interests and establish a rapport right off the bat. While your interests shouldn&#8217;t be the main focus during the interview, making a mention of them and finding some mutually shared interests will help the interviewer remember you and\u00a0could help solidify you as the culture fit the team has been looking for.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_column_text]Interviewing is stressful, but don&#8217;t let your nerves or a lack of preparation cost you your next dream job.
