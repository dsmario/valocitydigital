Networking events like these are extremely helpful in getting face time with the qualified, hard-to-reach talent you&#8217;re looking for.<\/p>\n<p>This event series draws in qualified candidates interested in current internal openings at Mondo as either Account Directors or Technical Recruiters and gives them a chance to get to know our business and culture.<\/p>\n<p>Our incredible team of Career Agents organized the event and were thrilled with the turnout.\u00a0When asked how it went,\u00a0Alicia Romano, the Jr. Team Lead Career Agent, said, &#8220;It was actually the best networking event we&#8217;ve had in the NYC office so far. The Mondo employees that helped run the event really enjoyed it and the candidates had a great time while learning a lot about what we do here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Isabella Kyak, an attendee, found &#8220;Mingle with Mondo&#8221; to be one of the best candidate and networking events she&#8217;s attended. &#8220;I definitely loved the casual feel, while still being a professional event. When I did speak with the Managers that attended, you could tell how engaged they were by the questions they asked about my background and experience,&#8221; said Kyak. &#8220;The way they talked about Mondo was also very telling. You could tell they believed in the company and the mission.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When asked about her overall experience with the event, Kyak\u00a0responded, &#8220;People should definitely come to these networking events. It&#8217;s definitely worth it, and the follow-up after the event was incredible.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For anyone who missed this installment of our NYC networking event, &#8220;Mingle with Mondo,&#8221; there will be more opportunities coming soon. Given the success of the past two networking events, Romano plans on expanding the series with the rest of the Career Agents team. &#8220;Our goal moving forward is to host these events quarterly in NYC, as well as in our other offices,&#8221; said Romano.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in a career that offers uncapped commission and an unbeatable company culture, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/contact\/\">contact Mondo<\/a>\u00a0today!
