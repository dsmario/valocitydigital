These advancements have improved our lives, making our tasks easier than ever before. However, each tech improvement forces you and your employees to adapt. Adapting or conforming causes the perception of pressure.

Sean Parker, the co-founder of Facebook, admitted that the platform&#8217;s starting goal was to consume as much of the users\u2019 time and attention as possible; noting that there is a conscious effort to\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2017\/nov\/09\/facebook-sean-parker-vulnerability-brain-psychology\">manipulate individual\u2019s psychology<\/a>.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Ultimately, social media platforms heavily influence our levels of dopamine, the chemical trigger that keeps your employees hooked and leads to an increase in technostress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever catch your employees scrolling endlessly through their social media feeds?

However, limiting the use of smartphones during work hours is a step towards reducing technostress. You can start with a no-phone rule during meetings; it\u2019s as simple as banning them from the meeting room. Creating a phone ban will remove the interrupting vibrations of an incoming call or a distracting Twitter chirp. Regulating phone use gives your business the opportunity to\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/usa.kaspersky.com\/about\/press-releases\/2016_kaspersky-lab-study-proves-smartphones-distract-workers-and-decrease-productivity\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">capture every employee&#8217;s attention<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ensuring everyone is focused on the discussions and topics at hand.

One approach is to create a company-wide email curfew regulating when employees can and can&#8217;t send emails. Your Tech talent will have the chance to create a better work-life balance when they are given the opportunity to remove the stress placed on answering emails outside of work, which can lead to enhanced innovations, improved work-performance and more revenue due to the lack of technostress exposure.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Unlimited PTO:<\/strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thought of your employees taking less time off may sound appealing and cost-efficient, but offering limited time-off will ultimately lead to an increase in your turnover rate.

Employees will likely outperform their previous work with a renewed sense of energy and direction. An unlimited PTO policy will force your employees to take a break from their work-related devices and networks, reducing the effects of technostress.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]Isn\u2019t it interesting that the more we shift and shape the technology around us, the more these technologies not only shape the way we live but also alter our relationships, work habits and our mental and physical health? Don\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late. Make sure your company is aware of the threat technostress poses before your employees show signs of social media fatigue, nomophobia or any other side effects of this tech-related disorder. \u00a0Ensure your business integrates procedures and regulations to lessen and end the impact technostress has on your Tech specialists.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row row_height_percent=&#8221;0&#8243;
