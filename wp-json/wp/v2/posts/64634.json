(If you&#8217;ve already begun the hiring process then you know firsthand how challenging it is.) With the emergence of job posting sites like Indeed, CareerBuilder, and Monster along with professional networking sites like LinkedIn, you would think sourcing the high-end talent you&#8217;re missing would\u00a0be as easy as posting the job description or typing in the job title and clicking search to give you a wealth of high-end candidates. But, as the leading nationwide staffing agency specializing in IT, Tech, and Digital Marketing talent, we know it&#8217;s never that easy. In fact, Tech and Digital Marketing jobs are some of the hardest roles to fill across all industries.<\/p>\n<p>How tough is it? Tech is arguably the hardest specialization area\u00a0to hire for, given the growing Tech talent gap facing not only the U.S. but the world at large. As Digital Marketing\u00a0roles continue their tech-driven evolution, finding high-end experts with a knowledge of key Digital Marketing practices, concepts, and insights along with several years experience with the latest, in-demand Marketing tech tools is like finding a unicorn. (But, don&#8217;t worry. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been doing successfully for over 15 years.)<\/p>\n<p>To give you an inside look at the current state of hiring for Tech and Digital Marketing, here&#8217;s a look at the four hardest roles to fill in IT\/Tech and Digital Marketing based on our exclusive placement data.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space empty_h=&#8221;2&#8243;][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h1>4 Hardest Roles to Fill in IT\/Tech<\/h1>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/hire-front-end-developers\/\">Front-End Developer<\/a><\/strong>: It should be no surprise that this development role is at the top of the list. Since these experts are responsible for developing all aspects of a business&#8217; website and apps for consumer use, clearly they are a top priority for any business looking to improve and maintain their online offerings. As such, they command some of the highest salaries and candidates often spend less than a week on the market when\u00a0looking for new opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/hire-data-scientists\/\">Data Scientist<\/a>:<\/strong> Different than a Data Analyst based on the scope of data they are examining, Data Scientists are another of the hardest roles to fill in IT. Due to the invaluable insights these data experts uncover for companies and their ability to easily communicate findings to those unfamiliar with the specifics of data analysis,\u00a0demand for this role continues to rise.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/hire-software-dev-consultants\/\">Full-Stack Developer<\/a>:<\/strong> As companies look to improve both the back-end and front-end of their business technologies\u00a0without dramatically expanding their development team, demand for the Full-Stack Developer title is growing. Since these experts can seamlessly move between back-end and front-end development needs, they are viewed as an essential hire. However, rising demand has made specialized talent harder to find and thus made the role harder to fill.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/hire-software-architects\/\">Software Architect<\/a>:<\/strong> The development of enterprise software to improve and augment the effectiveness of a company&#8217;s infrastructure has never been more popular thanks to the rise of the cloud and emerging technologies. Due to this, software development talent is in top demand. Software Architects are generally available on the market for only a few days, making it feel impossible to fill this position.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h2>4 Hardest Roles to Fill in Digital Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243;][uncode_list icon=&#8221;fa fa-check&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/hire-a-digital-marketing-manager\/\">Digital Marketing Manager<\/a>:<\/strong> Digital Marketing Managers are in short supply, which makes things challenging considering the explosive growth of Digital Marketing in recent years and the emergence of various automation tools that companies expect talent to have years of experience with. The importance of a strategic, high-end Digital Marketing leader developing and implementing top strategies and initiatives to improve online marketing efforts in today&#8217;s digitally driven environment cannot be emphasized enough, which explains why it&#8217;s one of the hardest roles to fill.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/hire-uxui-designers\/\">UI\/UX Designer<\/a>:<\/strong> Improving the experience of the user on your website, app, or other online product is essential to boosting clicks, increasing conversions, and generating more revenue. As the market shifts and begins to expect UI\/UX Designers to have development capabilities as well, this role has become more and more difficult to fill. The niche set of skills needed for this role often leaves companies fighting over the same high-end candidates because they are so hard to come by.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/hire-seo-sem-consultants\/\">SEO Specialist<\/a>:<\/strong> Organic search is a driving factor behind clicks to your website. Due to the vast impact this has on revenue generation by driving consumers from\u00a0their search engine query to your business website for service, the title of SEO Specialist is one of the hardest roles to fill thanks to the demand for their\u00a0exclusive SEO expertise.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mondo.com\/hire-marketing-automation-specialists\/\">Marketing Automation Specialist<\/a>:<\/strong> With the popularity of marketing automation platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketo.com\/\">Marketo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/\">HubSpot<\/a>, businesses must hire Marketing Automation Specialists versed in the intricacies of the platform to best utilize them for Digital Marketing needs. The rare versatility of the Marketing Automation Specialist role makes it so challenging to fill because these platforms have only been around for a few years, meaning talent with several years of experience with them is rare.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/uncode_list][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_custom_heading heading_semantic=&#8221;div&#8221; text_size=&#8221;h3&#8243; text_height=&#8221;fontheight-357766&#8243; text_font=&#8221;font-148806&#8243; text_color=&#8221;color-prif&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;alpha-anim&#8221; animation_speed=&#8221;500&#8243; animation_delay=&#8221;100&#8243;]<strong>Looking Ahead<\/strong>[\/vc_custom_heading][vc_column_text]Sourcing the high-end, niche IT, Tech, and Digital Marketing talent you need is a challenge, but we&#8217;ve proven finding great talent is possible when you partner with us.
